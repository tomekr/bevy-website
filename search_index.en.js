Especially when there are already so many in the Rust ecosystem?\nFirst a bit about me: I decided to build Bevy after years of contributing code to other engines (ex: Godot). I spent over four years building a game in Godot and I also have experience with Unity, Unreal, and a number of other frameworks like SDL and Three.js. I have built multiple custom engines in the past using Rust, Go, HTML5, and Java. I have also used and/or closely followed most of the current players in the Rust gamedev ecosystem. I recently quit my job as Senior Software Engineer at Microsoft and my experience there deeply affected my opinions of software and what it should be.\nThese experiences led me to want the following from a game engine:\n\nFree and Open Source: It needs to be free and open source with no strings attached. Games are a huge part of our culture and humanity is investing millions of hours into the development of games. Why are we (as game developers / engine developers) continuing to build up the ecosystems of closed-source monopolies that take cuts of our sales and deny us visibility into the tech we use daily? As a community I believe we can do so much better. This criteria eliminates Unreal and Unity, despite their huge feature sets.\nProductive: It needs to have fast build/run/test loops, which translates to either scripting languages or fast compile times in native languages. But scripting languages introduce runtime overhead, cognitive load, and a barrier between me and the actual engine, so my preference here is a native language with fast compile times. Sadly compile times are a huge problem in the Rust ecosystem and many Rust engines have prohibitively long iterative compiles. Fortunately Rust game engines like Macroquad and coffee prove that productive iterative compile times are possible.\nTurtles All The Way Down: Ideally the engine is written in the same language that games are. Being able to run an IDE \"go to definition\" command on a symbol in your game and hop directly into the engine source is an extremely powerful concept. You also don't need to worry about heavy language translation layers or lossy abstractions. If an engine's community builds games in the same language as the engine, they are more likely (and able) to contribute back to the engine.\nSimple: It needs to be easy to use for common tasks, but it also can't hide the details from you. Many engines are either \"easy to use but too high level\" or \"very low level but difficult to do common tasks in\". Additionally, many engines in Rust are littered with lifetimes and generics. Both are powerful tools to be sure, but they also introduce cognitive load and reduce ergonomics. Generics can also have a huge impact on compile times if you aren't careful.\nEditor: It needs to have an (optional) graphical editor. Scene creation is a large part of game development and in many cases visual editors beat code. As a bonus, the editor should be built in the engine. Godot uses this approach and it is so smart. Doing so dogfoods the engine's UI system and creates positive feedback loops. Improvements to the editor are also often improvements to the core engine. It also makes sure your engine is flexible enough to build tooling (and not just games). I personally consider building an engine's editor in another stack to be a missed opportunity (ex: the web, QT, native widgets). \nData Driven: It needs to be data-driven/data-oriented/data-first. ECS is a common way of doing this, but it definitely isn't the only way. These paradigms can make your game faster (cache friendly, easier to parallelize), but they also make common tasks like game state serialization and synchronization delightfully straightforward.\n\nNone of the engines on the market quite line up with what I'm looking for. And the changes required to make them meet my requirements are either massive in scope, impossible (closed source), or unwelcome (the things I want aren't what the developers or customers want). On top of that, making new game engines is fun!\nBevy is not trying to out-compete other open-source game engines. As much as possible we should be collaborating and building common foundations. If you are an open source game engine developer and you think a Bevy component would make your engine better, one of your engine's components could make Bevy better, or both, please reach out! Bevy is already benefitting massively from the efforts of the Rust gamedev ecosystem and we would love to pay it forward in whatever way we can.\n","id":"https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/faq/","title":"Faq"},"https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/":{"body":"This section will help you get started on your Bevy journey as quickly as possible.

The simplest Bevy app looks like this:\nuse bevy::prelude::*;\n\nfn main() {\n    App::build().run();\n}\n\nNice and simple right? Copy the code above into your main.rs file, then run:\ncargo run\n\nin your project folder. You will notice that ... nothing happens. This is because we haven't told our app to do anything yet! Apps are just empty shells capable of running our application logic. Let's add some logic to our App using Bevy ECS.\n","id":"https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/apps/","title":"Apps"},"https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/ecs/":{"body":"All app logic in Bevy uses the Entity Component System paradigm, which is often shortened to ECS. ECS is a software pattern that involves breaking your program up into Entities, Components, and Systems. Entities are unique \"things\" that are assigned groups of Components, which are then processed using Systems.\nFor example, one entity might have a Position and Velocity component, whereas another entity might have a Position and UI component. Systems are logic that runs on a specific set of component types. You might have a movement system that runs on all entities with a Position and Velocity component.\nThe ECS pattern encourages clean, decoupled designs by forcing you to break up your app data and logic into its core components. It also helps make your code faster by optimizing memory access patterns and making parallelism easier.\nBevy ECS\nBevy ECS is Bevy's implementation of the ECS pattern. Unlike other Rust ECS implementations, which often require complex lifetimes, traits, builder patterns, or macros, Bevy ECS uses normal Rust datatypes for all of these concepts:\n\nComponents: normal Rust structsstruct Position { x: f32, y: f32 }\n\nSystems: normal Rust functionsfn print_position_system(query: Query&lt;&amp;Transform&gt;) {\n    for transform in query.iter() {\n        println!(\"position: {:?}\", transform.translation);\n    }\n}\n\nEntities: a simple type containing a unique integerstruct Entity(u64);\n\n\nNow let's see how this works in practice!\nYour First System\nPaste the following function into your main.rs file:\nfn hello_world() {\n    println!(\"hello world!\");\n}\n\nThis will be our first system. The only remaining step is to add it to our App!\nfn main() {\n    App::build()\n        .add_system(hello_world.system())\n        .run();\n}\n\nNote the hello_world.system() function call. This is a \"trait extension method\" that converts the hello_world function into the System\n type.\nThe add_system()\n function adds the system to your App's Schedule\n, but we'll cover that more later.\nNow run your App again using cargo run. You should see hello world! printed once in your terminal.\nYour First Components\nGreeting the whole world is great, but what if we want to greet specific people? In ECS, you would generally model people as entities with a set of components that define them. Let's start simple with a Person component.\nAdd this struct to main.rs:\nstruct Person;\n\nBut what if we want our people to have a name? In a more traditional design, we might just tack on a name: String field to Person. But other entities might have names too! For example, dogs should probably also have a name. It often makes sense to break datatypes up in to small pieces to encourage code reuse. So let's make Name its own component:\nstruct Name(String);\n\nWe can then add People to our World\n using a \"startup system\". Startup systems are just like normal systems, but they run exactly once, before all other systems, right when our app starts. Let's use Commands\n to spawn some entities into our World\n:\nfn add_people(commands: &amp;mut Commands) {\n    commands\n        .spawn((Person, Name(\"Elaina Proctor\".to_string())))\n        .spawn((Person, Name(\"Renzo Hume\".to_string())))\n        .spawn((Person, Name(\"Zayna Nieves\".to_string())));\n}\n\nNow register the startup system like this:\nfn main() {\n    App::build()\n        .add_startup_system(add_people.system())\n        .add_system(hello_world.system())\n        .run();\n}\n\nWe could run this App now and the add_people system would run first, followed by hello_world. But our new people don't have anything to do yet! Let's make a system that properly greets the new citizens of our World\n:\nfn greet_people(query: Query&lt;&amp;Name, With&lt;Person&gt;&gt;) {\n    for name in query.iter() {\n        println!(\"hello {}!\", name.0);\n    }\n}\n\nThe parameters we pass in to a \"system function\" define what data the system runs on. In this case, greet_people will run on all entities with the Person and Name component.\nYou can interpret the Query above as: \"iterate over every Name component for entities that also have a Person component\"\nNow we just register the system in our App:\nfn main() {\n    App::build()\n        .add_startup_system(add_people.system())\n        .add_system(hello_world.system())\n        .add_system(greet_people.system())\n        .run();\n}\n\nRunning our app will result in the following output:\nhello world!\nhello Elaina Proctor!\nhello Renzo Hume!\nhello Zayna Nieves!\n\nMarvelous!\nQuick Note: \"hello world!\" might show up in a different order than it does above. This is because systems run in parallel by default when they have no shared dependencies.\n","id":"https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/ecs/","title":"ECS"},"https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/plugins/":{"body":"One of Bevy's core principles is modularity. All Bevy engine features are implemented as plugins. This includes internal features like the renderer, but games themselves are also implemented as plugins! This empowers developers to pick and choose which features they want. Don't need a UI? Don't register the UiPlugin\n. Want to build a headless server? Don't register the RenderPlugin\n.\nThis also means you are free to replace any components you don't like. If you feel the need, you are welcome to build your own UiPlugin\n, but consider contributing it back to Bevy if you think it would be useful!\nHowever, most developers don't need a custom experience and just want the \"full engine\" experience with no hassle. For this, Bevy provides a set of \"default plugins\".\nBevy's Default Plugins\nLet's make our app more interesting by adding the \"default Bevy plugins\". \nadd_plugins(DefaultPlugins) adds the features most people expect from an engine, such as a 2D / 3D renderer, asset loading, a UI system, windows, and input. \nfn main() {\n    App::build()\n        .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)\n        .add_startup_system(add_people.system())\n        .add_system(hello_world.system())\n        .add_system(greet_people.system())\n        .run();\n}\n\nOnce again run cargo run.\nYou should hopefully notice two things:\n\nA window should pop up. This is because we now have WindowPlugin\n, which defines the window interface (but doesn't actually know how to make windows), and WinitPlugin\n which uses the winit library to create a window using your OS's native window api.\nYour console is now full of \"hello\" messages: This is because DefaultPlugins\n adds an \"event loop\" to our application. Our App's ECS Schedule now runs in a loop once per \"frame\". We will resolve the console spam in a moment.\n\nNote that add_plugins(DefaultPlugins) is equivalent to the following:\nfn main() {\n    App::build()\n        .add_plugin(CorePlugin::default())\n        .add_plugin(InputPlugin::default())\n        .add_plugin(WindowPlugin::default())\n        /* more plugins omitted for brevity */\n        .run();\n}\n\nYou are free to use whatever approach suits you!\nCreating your first plugin\nFor better organization, let's move all of our \"hello\" logic to a plugin. To create a plugin we just need to implement the Plugin\n interface. Add the following code to your main.rs file:\npub struct HelloPlugin;\n\nimpl Plugin for HelloPlugin {\n    fn build(&amp;self, app: &amp;mut AppBuilder) {\n        // add things to your app here\n    }\n}\n\nThen register the plugin in your App like this:\nfn main() {\n    App::build()\n        .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)\n        .add_plugin(HelloPlugin)\n        .add_startup_system(add_people.system())\n        .add_system(hello_world.system())\n        .add_system(greet_people.system())\n        .run();\n}\n\nNow all thats left is to move our systems into HelloPlugin, which is just a matter of cut and paste. The app variable in our plugin's build() function is the same builder type we use in our main() function:\nimpl Plugin for HelloPlugin {\n    fn build(&amp;self, app: &amp;mut AppBuilder) {\n        app.add_startup_system(add_people.system())\n            .add_system(hello_world.system())\n            .add_system(greet_people.system());\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    App::build()\n        .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)\n        .add_plugin(HelloPlugin)\n        .run();\n}\n\nTry running the app again. It should do exactly what it did before. In the next section, we'll fix the \"hello\" spam using Resources. \n","id":"https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/plugins/","title":"Plugins"},"https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/resources/":{"body":"Entities and Components are great for representing complex, query-able groups of data. But most Apps will also require \"globally unique\" data of some kind. In Bevy ECS, we represent globally unique data using Resources.\nHere are some examples of data that could be encoded as Resources:\n\nElapsed Time\nAsset Collections (sounds, textures, meshes)\nRenderers\n\nTracking Time with Resources\nLet's solve our App's \"hello spam\" problem by only printing \"hello\" once every two seconds. We'll do this by using the Time\n resource, which is automatically added to our App via add_plugins(DefaultPlugins).\nFor simplicity, remove the hello_world system from your App. This way we only need to adapt the greet_people system.\nResources are accessed in much the same way that we access components. You can access the Time resource in your system like this:\nfn greet_people(time: Res&lt;Time&gt;, query: Query&lt;&amp;Name, With&lt;Person&gt;&gt;) {\n    for name in query.iter() {\n        println!(\"hello {}!\", name.0);\n    }\n}\n\nRes and ResMut pointers provide read and write access (respectively) to resources.\nThe delta_seconds field on Time gives us the time that has passed since the last update. But in order to run our system once every two seconds, we must track the amount of time that has passed over a series of updates. To make this easier, Bevy provides the Timer type. Let's create a new Resource for our system to track elapsed time with a Timer:\nstruct GreetTimer(Timer);\n\nfn greet_people(\n    time: Res&lt;Time&gt;, mut timer: ResMut&lt;GreetTimer&gt;, query: Query&lt;&amp;Name, With&lt;Person&gt;&gt;) {\n    // update our timer with the time elapsed since the last update\n    // if the timer hasn't finished yet, we return\n    if !timer.0.tick(time.delta_seconds()).just_finished() {\n        return;\n    }\n\n    for name in query.iter() {\n        println!(\"hello {}!\", name.0);\n    }\n}\n\nNow all thats left is adding a GreetTimer Resource to our HelloPlugin:\nimpl Plugin for HelloPlugin {\n    fn build(&amp;self, app: &amp;mut AppBuilder) {\n        // the reason we call from_seconds with the true flag is to make the timer repeat itself\n        app.add_resource(GreetTimer(Timer::from_seconds(2.0, true)))\n            .add_startup_system(add_people.system())\n            .add_system(greet_people.system());\n    }\n}\n\nNow cargo run the App. It should now greet people at a reasonable rate.\n","id":"https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/resources/","title":"Resources"},"https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/setup/":{"body":"I know you are itching to start making games, but we need to do a small amount of setup first.\nRust Setup\nAll Bevy app and engine code is written in Rust.

If you would like to learn more about the Rust language, check out the following resources:\n\nThe Rust Book: the best place to learn Rust from scratch\nRust by Example: learn Rust by working through live coding examples\n\nCreate a new Bevy Project\nNow we are ready to set up a Bevy project! Bevy is just a normal Rust dependency. You can either add it to an existing Rust project or create a new one. For completeness we will assume you are starting from scratch.\nCreate a new Rust executable project\nFirst, navigate to a folder where you want to create your new project. Then, run the following command to create a new folder containing our rust executable project:\ncargo new my_bevy_game\ncd my_bevy_game\n\nNow run cargo run to build and run your project. You should see Hello, world! printed to your terminal. Open the my_bevy_game folder in your code editor of choice and take some time to look through the files.\nmain.rs is the entry point of your program:\nfn main() {\n    println!(\"Hello, world!\");\n}\n\nCargo.toml is your \"project file\". It contains metadata about your project such as its name, dependencies, and build configuration.\n[package]\nname = \"my_bevy_game\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\nauthors = [\"You &lt;you@veryrealemail.com&gt;\"]\nedition = \"2018\"\n\n[dependencies]\nAdd Bevy to your project's Cargo.toml\nBevy is available as a library on crates.io, the official Rust package repository. Find the latest version number () and add it to your Cargo.toml file:\n[package]\nname = \"my_bevy_game\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\nauthors = [\"You &lt;you@veryrealemail.com&gt;\"]\nedition = \"2018\"\n\n[dependencies]\nbevy = \"0.4\" # make sure this is the latest version\nEnable Fast Compiles (Optional)\nBevy can be built just fine using default configuration on stable Rust. However for maximally fast iterative compiles, we recommend the following configuration:\n\nEnable Bevy's Dynamic Linking Feature: This is the biggest iterative compilation time win and requires no special setup. When you have bevy as a dependency you can run your app with dynamic linking like this:cargo run --features bevy/dynamic\n\nLLD linker: The Rust compiler spends a lot of time in the \"link\" step. LLD is much faster at linking than the default Rust linker. To install LLD, find your OS below and run the given command:\n\nUbuntu: sudo apt-get install lld\nArch: sudo pacman -S lld\nWindows: Ensure you have the latest cargo-binutilscargo install -f cargo-binutils\nrustup component add llvm-tools-preview\n\nMacOS: Modern LLD does not yet support MacOS, but we can use zld instead: brew install michaeleisel/zld/zld\n\n\nNightly Rust Compiler: This gives access to the latest performance improvements and \"unstable\" optimizations# Install the nightly toolchain\nrustup toolchain install nightly\n# Configure your current project to use nightly (run this command within the project)\nrustup override set nightly\n# OR configure cargo to use nightly for all projects -- switch back with `rustup default stable`\nrustup default nightly\n\n\nYou can use cargo +nightly ... if you don't want to change the default to nightly.\n\n\nGeneric Sharing: Allows crates to share monomorphized generic code instead of duplicating it. In some cases this allows us to \"precompile\" generic code so it doesn't affect iterative compiles. This is only available on nightly Rust.\n\nTo enable fast compiles, install the nightly rust compiler and LLD. Then copy this file to YOUR_WORKSPACE/.cargo/config.toml. For the project in this guide, that would be my_bevy_game/.cargo/config.toml.\nIf something went wrong, check out our troubleshooting section or ask for help on our Discord. \nBuild Bevy\nNow run cargo run again. The Bevy dependencies should start building. This will take some time as you are essentially building an engine from scratch. You will only need to do a full rebuild once.

You can check out Quick Start Guide to get started. Bevy is also free and open source forever! You can grab the full source code on GitHub.\nHere are some of the highlights from this release:\nAsync Task System\nauthors: @lachlansneff and @aclysma\nBevy uses multi-threading throughout the engine: ECS scheduling, asset loading, rendering, etc. Before this release it used Rayon for almost all of these tasks. Rayon is nice because it is generally as simple as calling some_list.par_iter().for_each(|x| do_something(x)). Rayon then automatically breaks the for_each into tasks and runs them on as many cores as it can. Rayon is a great choice if you want to easily parallelize code, but it has the downside of being pretty cpu-hungry.\nBevy (and a number of other rust game engines and ecs frameworks using rayon) have received feedback that they were overly cpu hungry / usage was not proportional to \"real\" work done.\nWe decided to resolve this problem by building a custom async-friendly task system, which enables the creation of context-specific task pools. For example, you might have separate pools for compute, IO, networking, etc. This also gives us the flexibility to load balance work appropriately according to work type and/or priority. The cpu usage wins have been huge:\nTotal Combined Percent CPU Usage - 8 Core Machine (smaller is better)\n\nTotal Combined Percent CPU Usage - 32 Core Machine (smaller is better)\n\nInitial Web Platform Support\nauthors: @smokku\n(A subset of) Bevy now runs on the web using WebAssembly/WASM! Specifically, Bevy apps can run Bevy ECS schedules, react to input events, create an empty canvas (using winit), and a few other things. This is a huge first step, but it is important to call out that there are still a number of missing pieces, such as 2D/3D rendering, multi-threading, and sound. \nThose limitations haven't stopped @mrk-its from building the first WASM Bevy game!\nbevy-robbo (playable here)\n\nThey use Bevy for game logic and cleverly work around the render limitations by passing ASCII art game state from this Bevy system to this JavaScript function. \nYou can play around with some Bevy WASM examples by following the instructions here.\nParallel Queries\nauthors: @GrantMoyer\nBevy ECS Queries are a flexible way to retrieve data from the Entity Component System. Systems that use queries already run in parallel, but before this change the queries themselves could not be iterated in parallel. Bevy 0.2 adds the ability to easily iterate queries in parallel:\nfn system(pool: Res&lt;ComputeTaskPool&gt;, mut query: Query&lt;&amp;mut Transform&gt;) {\n    query.iter().par_iter(32).for_each(&amp;pool, |mut transform| {\n      transform.translate(Vec3::new(1.0, 0.0, 0.0));\n    });\n}\n\nThis provides a nice functional api (similar to Rayon) that runs on top of the new bevy_tasks system. It breaks the query up into 32 \"batches\" and runs each batch as a different task in the bevy task system. \nTransform System Rewrite\nauthors: @MarekLg\n// old\nfn system(translation: &amp;Translation, rotation: &amp;Rotation, scale: &amp;Scale) {\n  println!(\"{} {} {}\", translation.0, rotation.0, scale.0);\n}\n\n// new\nfn system(transform: &amp;Transform) {\n  println!(\"{} {} {}\", transform.translation(), transform.rotation(), transform.scale());\n}\n\nBevy's old transform system used separate Translation, Rotation, and Scale components as the \"source of truth\". Users modified with these components in their systems, after which they were synced to a LocalTransform component, which was in turn synced to a global Transform component, taking hierarchy into account. This was nice for a couple of reasons:\n\nSlightly more cache efficient to retrieve individual components like Translation (because less data needs to be accessed)\nTheoretically more parallel-friendly. Systems that only access Translation won't block systems accessing Rotation.\n\nHowever this approach also has some pretty serious downsides:\n\nThe \"individual components\" are the source of truth, so LocalTransform is out of date when user systems are running. If an up to date \"full transform\" is needed, it must be manually constructed by accessing all three components.\nVery hard to reason about. There are 5 components users need to think about and they all interact with each other differently.\nSetting a Transform to a specific matrix value (ex: Mat4::look_at()) was extremely cumbersome, and the value would be immediately overwritten unless the user explicitly disabled component syncing.\n\nGiven these issues, we decided to move to a single unified local-to-parent Transform component as the source of truth, and a computed GlobalTransform component for world-space transforms. We think this api will be much easier to use and to reason about. Unity is also considering a similar Transform rework for their ECS and a lot of discussion on this topic happened in this Amethyst Forum Thread.\nJoystick/Gamepad Input\nauthors: @simpuid\nThe Bevy Input plugin now has cross-platform support for most controllers thanks to the gilrs library!\nfn button_system(gamepads: Res&lt;Vec&lt;Gamepad&gt;&gt;, button_input: Res&lt;Input&lt;GamepadButton&gt;&gt;) {\n    for gamepad in gamepads.iter() {\n        if button_input.just_pressed(GamepadButton(*gamepad, GamepadButtonType::RightTrigger)) {\n            println!(\"Pressed right trigger!\");\n        }\n    }\n}\nBevy ECS Performance Improvements\nauthors: @cart\nGenerational Entity IDs\nWe changed Entity IDs from being random UUIDs to incrementing generational indices. Random UUIDs were nice because they could be created anywhere, were unique across game runs, and could be safely persisted to files or reused across networks. I was really hoping we could make them work, but they ended up being too slow relative to the alternatives. The randomness had a measurable cost and entity locations had to be looked up using a hash map.\nBy moving to generational indices (we use the hecs implementation), we can directly use entity ids as array indices, which makes entity location lookups lightning fast.\nRead Only Queries\nI implemented \"read only\" traits for queries that don't mutate anything. This allows us to guarantee that a query won't mutate anything.\nRemoved locking from World apis\nThis gives us a really nice speed boost. We can do this safely due to a combination of the new \"read only queries\" and changing World mutation apis to be a mutable World borrow.\nThis is not yet enabled for Queries in systems because a system could have multiple Queries, which could be simultaneously accessed in a way that doesn't make mutable access unique. I think thats a solve-able problem, but it will take a bit more work. Fortunately \"for-each\" systems don't have any collision risk, so we now use lock-less queries there.\nDirect component lookup (in nanoseconds, smaller is better)\nAs a result of these optimizations, direct component lookup is much faster than it used to be:\n\nNote that this benchmark used world.get::&lt;T&gt;(entity). query.get::&lt;T&gt;(entity) should have results similar to the hecs results because it still uses a lock. Eventually I'm hoping that we can remove locks from system queries too.\nChange Log\nAdded\n\nTask System for Bevy\n\nReplaces rayon with a custom designed task system that consists of several \"TaskPools\".\nExports IOTaskPool, ComputePool, and AsyncComputePool in bevy_tasks crate.\n\n\nParallel queries for distributing work over with the ParallelIterator trait.\n\ne.g. query.iter().par_iter(batch_size).for_each(/* ... */)\n\n\nAdded gamepad support using Gilrs\nImplement WASM support for bevy_winit\nCreate winit canvas under WebAssembly \nImplement single threaded task scheduler for WebAssembly\nSupport for binary glTF (.glb).\nSupport for Or in ECS queries.\nAdded methods unload() and unload_sync() on SceneSpawner for unloading scenes..\nCustom rodio source for audio.\n\nAudioOuput is now able to play anything Decodable.\n\n\nColor::hex for creating Color from string hex values.\n\nAccepts the forms RGB, RGBA, RRGGBB, and RRGGBBAA.\n\n\nColor::rgb_u8 and Color::rgba_u8.\nAdded bevy_render::pass::ClearColor to prelude.\nSpriteResizeMode may choose how Sprite resizing should be handled.

This one is also hot off the presses: some features will work and others probably won't.\nThis was another large group effort that spanned multiple projects:\n\nBevy: XCode Project / Example (@simlay with help from @MichaelHills)\nBevy: Runtime shader compilation using shaderc (@MichaelHills)\nBevy: Rodio upgrade (@Dash-L)\nBevy: Touch support (@naithar)\nWinit: Fix iOS portrait view (@MichaelHills) \nRustAudio: iOS support (@simlay and @MichaelHills)\n\nKnown issues:\n\nAudio doesn't quite work yet\n\nWASM Asset Loading\nauthors: @mrk-its (and ported to the new AssetIo by @cart)\n@mrk-its has been hard at work on expanding Bevy's WASM support. In this release we landed WASM asset loading. You can now load assets when you publish to WASM just like you would on any other platform:\nasset_server.load(\"sprite.png\");\n\nIf the asset hasn't already been loaded, this will make a fetch() request to retrieve the asset over HTTP.\n@mrk-its has also been building a custom WebGL2 bevy_render backend. It is already pretty usable, but its not quite ready yet. Expect more news on this soon!\nTouch Input\nauthors: @naithar\nBevy now has support for touches:\nfn touch_system(touches: Res&lt;Touches&gt;) {\n    // you can iterate all current touches and retrieve their state like this:\n    for touch in touches.iter() {\n        println!(\"active touch: {:?}\", touch);\n    }\n\n    for touch in touches.iter_just_pressed() {\n        println!(\"just pressed {:?}\", touch);\n    }\n\n    for touch in touches.iter_just_released() {\n        println!(\"just released {:?}\", touch);\n    }\n\n    for touch in touches.iter_just_cancelled() {\n        println!(\"just cancelled {:?}\", touch);\n    }\n}\n\nYou can also consume raw touch events using the Events&lt;TouchInput&gt; resource.\nAsset System Improvements\nauthors: @cart\nAsset Handle Reference Counting\nAssets are now automatically freed when their \"handle reference count\" reaches zero. This means you no longer need to think about freeing assets manually:\n// Calling load() now returns a strong handle:\nlet handle = asset_server.load(\"sprite.png\");\n\n// Note that you no longer need to unwrap() loaded handles. Ergonomics for the win!\n\n// Cloning a handle increases the reference count by one\nlet second_handle = handle.clone();\n\n// Spawn a sprite and give it our handle\ncommands.spawn(SpriteComponents {\n    material: materials.add(handle.into()),\n    ..Default::default()\n});\n\n// Later in some other system:\ncommands.despawn(sprite_entity);\n\n// There are no more active handles to \"sprite.png\", so it will be freed before the next update\nAsset Loaders can now load multiple assets\nIn past releases, AssetLoaders could only produce a single asset of a single type. In Bevy 0.3, they can now produce any number of assets for any type. The old behavior was extremely limiting when loading assets like GLTF files, which might produce many meshes, textures, and scenes. \nSub-Asset Loading\nSometimes you only want to load a specific asset from an asset source. You can now load sub assets like this:\n// Mesh0/Primitive0 references the first mesh primitive in \"my_scene.gltf\"\nlet mesh = asset_server.load(\"my_scene.gltf#Mesh0/Primitive0\");\nAssetIo Trait\nThe AssetServer is now backed by the AssetIo trait. This allows us to load assets from whatever storage we want. This means on desktop we now load from the filesystem, on Android we use the Android Asset Manager, and on the web we make HTTP requests using the fetch() api.\nAsset Dependencies\nAssets can now depend on other assets, which will automatically be loaded when the original asset is loaded. This is useful when loading something like a \"scene\" which might reference other asset sources. We utilize this in our new GLTF loader.\nRemoved AssetServer::load_sync()\nThis might rustle some feathers, but AssetServer::load_sync() had to go! This api wasn't WASM friendly, encouraged users to block game execution for the sake of convenience (which causes \"hitching\"), and was incompatible with the new AssetLoader api. Asset loading is now always asynchronous. Users of load_sync() should instead load() their assets, check load status in their systems, and change game state accordingly. \nGLTF Scene Loader\nauthors: @cart\nUp until this point, the GLTF loader was painfully limited. It could only load the first mesh with a single texture in a GLTF file. For Bevy 0.3, we took advantage of the asset system improvements to write a new GltfLoader that loads GLTF files as Bevy Scenes, along with all meshes and textures in the files.\nHere's Bevy loading the Khronos Flight Helmet example, which consists of multiple meshes and textures!\n\nHere is the complete code for a system that loads a GLTF file and spawns it as a scene:\nfn load_gltf_system(mut commands: Commands, asset_server: Res&lt;AssetServer&gt;) {\n    let scene_handle = asset_server.load(\"models/FlightHelmet/FlightHelmet.gltf\");\n    commands.spawn_scene(scene_handle);\n}\nBevy ECS Improvements\nauthors: @cart\nQuery Ergonomics\nIn this release I finally was able to remove the one thing I truly despised in Bevy ECS. In previous versions of Bevy, iterating over the components in a Query looked like this:\nfor (a, b) in &amp;mut query.iter() {\n    // The `&amp;mut` here just felt so unnatural\n}\n\n// Or if you preferred you could do this\nfor (a, b) in query.iter().iter() {\n    // query.iter().iter()? Really???\n}\n\nSimilarly, retrieving a specific entity's component's looked like this:\nif let Ok(mut result) = query.entity(entity) {\n    if let Some((a, b)) = result.get() {\n        // access components here\n    }\n}\n\nIn Bevy 0.3 you can just do this:\n// iteration\nfor (a, b) in query.iter() {\n    // sweet ergonomic bliss\n}\n\n// entity lookup\nif let Ok((a,b)) = query.get(entity) {\n    // boilerplate be gone!\n}\n\nYou might naturally be thinking something like:\nWhy did this take so long? Why would removing a single &amp;mut be hard?\nIt's a long story! In summary:\n\nThe old api looked the way it did for a reason. It was the result of good design choices that protect against unsafe memory access in a parallel environment.\nquery.iter() didn't actually return an iterator. It returned a wrapper that held an atomic lock on the component storages. The same was true for the type returned by query.entity()\nRemoving these \"wrapper types\" would have allowed unsafe behavior because another Query could access the same components in a way that violated Rust's mutability rules.\nDue to the iterator implementation and quirks in the rust compiler, removing the wrapper type tanked iteration performance by about ~2-3x.\n\nFortunately we finally found ways to solve all of these problems. The newly added QuerySets allow us to completely remove the locks (and wrapper types). And by completely rewriting QueryIter we were able to avoid the performance hit that removing the wrapper incurred. Read on for the details!\n100% Lockless Parallel ECS\nBevy ECS is now completely lock free. In Bevy 0.2, we made direct World access and \"for-each\" systems lock free. This is possible because the Bevy ECS scheduler ensures that systems only run in parallel in ways that respect Rust's mutability rules. \nWe couldn't remove locks from Query systems because of systems like this:\nfn conflicting_query_system(mut q0: Query&lt;&amp;mut A&gt;, mut q1: Query&lt;(&amp;mut A, &amp;B)&gt;) {\n    let a = q0.get_mut(some_entity).unwrap();\n    let (another_a, b) = q1.get_mut(some_entity).unwrap();\n    // Aaah!!! We have two mutable references to some_entity's A component!\n    // Very unsafe!\n}\n\nThe locks ensured that the second q1.get_mut(some_entity) access panicked, keeping us nice and safe. In Bevy 0.3, a system like conflicting_query_system will fail when the schedule is constructed. By default, systems cannot have conflicting queries.\nHowever there are some cases where a system needs conflicting queries to do what it needs to do. For these cases, we added QuerySets: \nfn system(mut queries: QuerySet&lt;(Query&lt;&amp;mut A&gt;, Query&lt;(&amp;mut A, &amp;B)&gt;)&gt;) {\n    for a in queries.q0_mut().iter_mut() {\n    }\n\n    for (a, b) in queries.q1_mut().iter_mut() {\n    }\n}\n\nBy putting our conflicting Queries in a QuerySet, the Rust borrow checker protects us from unsafe query accesses.\nBecause of this, we were able to remove all safety checks from query.iter() and query.get(entity), which means these methods are now exactly as fast as their World counterparts (which we made lock-free in Bevy 0.2). \nPerformance Improvements\nBevy had a number of nice performance improvements this release:\n\nRemoved atomic locks from Query access, making Bevy ECS 100% lock free\nRemoved archetype \"safety checks\" from Query access. At this point we have already verified that the given Query access is safe, so we don't need to check again on every call.\nRewrote QueryIter to be simpler (and therefore easier to control optimizations for), which allowed us to remove the iterator wrapper without tanking performance. This also resolved some performance inconsistencies where some system permutations performed optimally and others didn't. Now everything is on the \"fast path\"!\nPorted some performance improvements from upstream hecs, which improved iteration over heavily fragmented archetypes and improved component insertion times\n\nGetting an Entity's Component (per 100k, in milliseconds, smaller is better)\nNote: these numbers are for getting a component 100,000 times, not for an individual component lookup\n\nThis is where the big wins were. By removing locks and safety checks from Query systems, we were able to significantly reduce the cost of retrieving a specific entity's component from within a system.\nI included a comparison to Legion ECS (another great archetypal ECS with a parallel scheduler) to illustrate why Bevy's new approach is so cool. Legion exposes a direct \"world like\" api (called a SubWorld) in its systems. The SubWorld's entry api cannot know ahead of time what types will be passed into it, which means it must do (relatively) expensive safety checks to ensure the user doesn't request access to something they shouldn't.\nBevy's scheduler pre-checks Queries once ahead of time, which allows systems to access their results without any additional checks.\nThe test was to lookup (and modify) a specific entity's component 100,000 times on each system iteration. Here is a quick rundown of how these tests were performed in each case:\n\nbevy (world): Direct World access using world.get_mut::&lt;A&gt;(entity)\nbevy (system): A system containing a Query&lt;&amp;mut A&gt; that accesses the component using query.get_mut(entity)\nlegion (world): Direct World access using let entry = world.entry(entity); entry.get_component_mut::&lt;A&gt;()\nlegion (system): A system with SubWorld access using let entry = world.entry(entity); entry.get_component_mut::&lt;A&gt;() \n\nIt's worth noting that using query.get_component::&lt;T&gt;(entity) instead of query.get(entity) does require safety checks, for the same reason the legion entry api does. We cannot know ahead of time what component type a caller will pass into the method, which means we must check it to make sure it matches the Query. \nAdditionally, here are some relevant ecs_bench_suite results (omitted benchmarks had no significant change):\nComponent Insertion (in microseconds, smaller is better)\n\nComponent Add/Remove (in milliseconds, smaller is better)\n\nFragmented Iteration (in nanoseconds, smaller is better)\n\nThread Local Resources\nSome resource types cannot (or should not) be passed between threads. This is often true for low level apis like windowing, input, and audio. It is now possible to add \"thread local resources\" to the Resources collection, which can only be accessed from the main thread using \"thread local systems\":\n// in your app setup\napp.add_thread_local_resource(MyResource);\n\n// a thread local system\nfn system(world: &amp;mut World, resources: &amp;mut Resources) {\n    let my_resource = resources.get_thread_local::&lt;MyResource&gt;().unwrap();\n}\nQuery Api Changes\nFirst, to improve clarity we renamed query.get::&lt;Component&gt;(entity) to query.get_component::&lt;Component&gt;(entity). We now return the \"full\" query result for a specific entity using query.get(entity).\nTo allow multiple concurrent reads of Queries (where it is safe), we added separate query.iter() and query.iter_mut() apis, as well as query.get(entity) and query.get_mut(entity). Queries that are \"read only\" can now retrieve their results via an immutable borrow.\nMesh Improvements\nFlexible Mesh Vertex Attributes\nauthors: @julhe\nBevy meshes used to require exactly three \"vertex attributes\": position, normal, and uv. This worked for most things, but there are a number of cases that require other attributes, such as \"vertex colors\" or \"bone weights for animation\". Bevy 0.3 adds support for custom vertex attributes. Meshes can define whatever attributes they want and shaders can consume whatever attributes they want!\nHere is an example that illustrates how to define a custom shader that consumes a mesh with an added \"vertex color\" attribute.\n\nIndex Buffer Specialization\nauthors: @termhn\nRendering meshes often involves using vertex \"indices\" to cut down on duplicate vertex information. Bevy used to hard code the precision of these indices to u16, which was too small for some cases. Now render pipelines can \"specialize\" based on a configured index buffer, which now defaults to u32 to cover most use cases.\nTransform Re-Rewrite\nauthors: @MarekLg (with some design help from @AThilenius, @bitshifter, @termhn, and @cart)\nTransforms are important to get right. They are used in many slices of the engine, user code touches them constantly, and they are relatively expensive to compute: especially transform hierarchies.\nIn the last release, we vastly simplified Bevy's transform system to use a consolidated Transform and GlobalTransform instead of multiple separate Translation, Rotation, and Scale components (which were synced to Transform and GlobalTransform). This made the user-facing api/dataflow simpler, as well as the underlying implementation. The Transform component was backed by a 4x4 matrix. I pressed the big green \"merge\" button ... happy that we had solved the Transform problem once and for all!\nIt turns out there was still more work to be done! @AThilenius pointed out that using a 4x4 matrix as the source of truth for an affine transform accumulates error over time. Additionally, the Transform api was still a little cumbersome to use. At the suggestion of @termhn we decided to investigate using a \"similarity\" as the source of truth. This had the following benefits:\n\nno more error accumulation\nwe could directly expose translation/rotation/scale fields, which simplified the api significantly\ncheaper to store and cheaper to compute hierarchies in some cases\n\nWe collectively decided this was a good path forward and now we have a re-rewrite that is even better. Yes this is another breaking change, but thats why we label Bevy as being in the \"experimentation phase\". Now is the time to break things as often as possible to ensure that we find good apis that will stand the test of time.\nThis is what the new Transform api looks like in a Bevy ECS system:\nfn system(mut transform: Mut&lt;Transform&gt;) {\n    // move along the positive x-axis\n    transform.translation += Vec3::new(1.0, 0.0, 0.0);\n\n    // rotate 180 degrees (pi) around the y-axis\n    transform.rotation *= Quat::from_rotation_y(PI);\n\n    // scale 2x\n    transform.scale *= 2.0;\n}\n\nCompared to the last version this is easier to use, more correct, and should also be slightly faster.\nGamepad Settings\nauthors: @simpuid\nThe newly added GamepadSettings resource gives developers the ability to customize gamepad settings on a per-controller, per-axis/button basis:\nfn system(mut gamepad_settings: ResMut&lt;GamepadSettings&gt;) {\n    gamepad_settings.axis_settings.insert(\n        GamepadAxis(Gamepad(0), GamepadAxisType::LeftStickX),\n        AxisSettings {\n            positive_high: 0.8,\n            positive_low: 0.01,\n            ..Default::default()\n        },\n    );\n}\nPlugin Groups\nauthors: @cart\nIf you've used Bevy, you're probably familiar with this part of App initialization:\napp.add_default_plugins();\n\nThis adds the plugins for all of the \"core\" engine functionality (rendering, input, audio, windowing, etc). It was straightforward, but also very static. What if you don't want to add all of the default plugins? What if you want to create your own custom set of plugins?\nTo resolve this, we added PluginGroups, which are ordered collections of plugins that can be individually enabled or disabled:\n// This:\napp.add_default_plugins()\n\n// Has been replaced by this:\napp.add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)\n\n// You can disable specific plugins in a PluginGroup:\napp.add_plugins_with(DefaultPlugins, |group| {\n    group.disable::&lt;RenderPlugin&gt;()\n         .disable::&lt;AudioPlugin&gt;()\n});\n\n// And you can create your own PluginGroups:\npub struct HelloWorldPlugins;\n\nimpl PluginGroup for HelloWorldPlugins {\n    fn build(&amp;mut self, group: &amp;mut PluginGroupBuilder) {\n        group.add(PrintHelloPlugin)\n             .add(PrintWorldPlugin);\n    }\n}\n\napp.add_plugins(HelloWorldPlugins);\nDynamic Window Settings\nauthors: @mockersf\nBevy provides a backend-agnostic windowing api. Up until this point, window settings could only be set once at app startup. If you wanted to set window settings dynamically, you had to directly interact with window backends (ex: winit).\nIn this release we added the ability to dynamically set window properties at runtime using the Bevy window abstraction:\n// This system dynamically sets the window title to the number of seconds since startup. Because why not?\nfn change_title(time: Res&lt;Time&gt;, mut windows: ResMut&lt;Windows&gt;) {\n    let window = windows.get_primary_mut().unwrap();\n    window.set_title(format!(\n        \"Seconds since startup: {}\", time.seconds_since_startup\n    ));\n}\nDocumentation Search-ability\nauthors: @memoryruins\nThe  bevy crate documentation search function now returns results for all sub-crates (like bevy_sprite). Due to how documentation is generated for re-exported crates, by default the bevy search index only covered the \"prelude\". @memoryruins found a way to fix this problem by creating new modules and exporting the contents of each crate within those modules (as opposed to aliasing the crates).\n\nChange Log\nAdded\n\nTouch Input\niOS XCode Project\nAndroid Example and use bevy-glsl-to-spirv 0.2.0\nIntroduce Mouse capture API\nbevy_input::touch: implement touch input\nD-pad support on MacOS\nSupport for Android file system\napp: PluginGroups and DefaultPlugins\n\nPluginGroup is a collection of plugins where each plugin can be enabled or disabled.\n\n\nSupport to get gamepad button/trigger values using Axis&lt;GamepadButton&gt;\nExpose Winit decorations\nEnable changing window settings at runtime\nExpose a pointer of EventLoopProxy to process custom messages\nAdd a way to specify padding/ margins between sprites in a TextureAtlas\nAdd bevy_ecs::Commands::remove for bundles\nimpl Default for TextureFormat\nExpose current_entity in ChildBuilder\nAppBuilder::add_thread_local_resource\nCommands::write_world_boxed takes a pre-boxed world writer to the ECS's command queue\nFrameTimeDiagnosticsPlugin now shows \"frame count\" in addition to \"frame time\" and \"fps\"\nAdd hierarchy example\nWgpuPowerOptions for choosing between low power, high performance, and adaptive power\nDerive Debug for more types: #597, #632 \nIndex buffer specialization\n\nAllows the use of U32 indices in Mesh index buffers in addition to the usual U16 indices\nSwitch to u32 indices by default\n\n\nMore instructions for system dependencies\n\nAdd systemd-devel for Fedora Linux dependencies\nAdd libudev-dev to Ubuntu dependencies\nAdd Void Linux to linux dependencies file\nWSL2 instructions\n\n\nSuggest -Zrun-dsymutil-no for faster compilation on MacOS\n\nChanged\n\necs: ergonomic query.iter(), remove locks, add QuerySets\n\nquery.iter() is now a real iterator!\nQuerySet allows working with conflicting queries and is checked at compile-time.\n\n\nRename query.entity() and query.get()\n\nquery.get::&lt;Component&gt;(entity) is now query.get_component::&lt;Component&gt;(entity)\nquery.entity(entity) is now query.get(entity)\n\n\nAsset system rework and GLTF scene loading\nIntroduces WASM implementation of AssetIo\nMove transform data out of Mat4\nSeparate gamepad state code from gamepad event code and other customizations\ngamepad: expose raw and filtered gamepad events\nDo not depend on spirv-reflect on wasm32 target\nMove dynamic plugin loading to its own optional crate\nAdd field to WindowDescriptor on wasm32 targets to optionally provide an existing canvas element as winit window\nAdjust how ArchetypeAccess tracks mutable &amp;

You can check out Quick Start Guide to get started. Bevy is also free and open source forever! You can grab the full source code on GitHub.\nHere are some of the highlights from this release:\nWASM + WebGL2\nauthors: @mrk-its\nBevy now has a WebGL2 render backend! @mrk-its has been hard at work building the Bevy WebGL2 Plugin and expanding bevy_render to meet the needs of the web. He also put together a nice website showcasing various Bevy examples and games running on the web. \nI think the results speak for themselves:\nBevy WebGL2 Showcase\n\nCross Platform Main Function\nauthors: @cart\nOn most supported Bevy platforms you can just use normal main functions (ex: Windows, MacOS, Linux, and Web). Here is the smallest possible Bevy app that runs on those platforms:\nuse bevy::prelude::*;\n\nfn main() {\n    App::build().run();\n}\n\nHowever some platforms (currently Android and iOS) require additional boilerplate. This arcane magic is error prone, takes up space, and isn't particularly nice to look at. Up until this point, Bevy users had to supply their own boilerplate ... but no more! Bevy 0.4 adds a new #[bevy_main] proc-macro, which inserts the relevant boilerplate for you. This is a big step toward our \"write once run anywhere\" goal.\nThis Bevy App has all the code required to run on Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android, iOS, and Web:\nuse bevy::prelude::*;\n\n#[bevy_main]\nfn main() {\n    App::build().run();\n}\nLive Shader Reloading\nauthors: @yrns\nBevy can now update changes to shaders at runtime, giving you instant feedback without restarting your app. This video isn't sped up!\n\nECS Improvements\nauthors: @cart\nIt wouldn't be a Bevy update without another round of ECS improvements!\nFlexible ECS Parameters\nPrior versions of Bevy forced you to provide system parameters in a specific order:\n/// This system followed the [Commands][Resources][Queries] order and compiled as expected\nfn valid_system(mut commands: Commands, time: Res&lt;Time&gt;, query: Query&lt;&amp;Transform&gt;) {\n}\n\n/// This system did not follow the required ordering, which caused compilation to fail\nfn invalid_system(query: Query&lt;&amp;Transform&gt;, mut commands: Commands, time: Res&lt;Time&gt;) {\n}\n\nNewbies would fall prey to this constantly. These completely arbitrary constraints were a quirk of the internal implementation. The IntoSystem trait was only implemented for specific orders. Supporting every order would have exponentially affected compile times. The internal implementation was also constructed with a famously complicated macro.\nTo resolve this, I completely rewrote how we generate systems. We now use a SystemParam trait, which we implement for each parameter type. This has a number of benefits:\n\nSignificantly Faster Compile Times: We're seeing a ~25% decrease in clean compile times\nUse Any Parameter Order You Want: No more arbitrary order restrictions!\nEasily Add New Parameters: It is now easy for us (and for users) to create new parameters. Just implement the SystemParam trait!\nSimpler Implementation: The new implementation is much smaller and also way easier to maintain and understand.\n\n// In Bevy 0.4 this system is now perfectly valid. Cool!\nfn system(query: Query&lt;&amp;Transform&gt;, commands: &amp;mut Commands, time: Res&lt;Time&gt;) {\n}\n\nNotice that in Bevy 0.4, commands now look like commands: &amp;mut Commands instead of mut commands: Commands. \nSimplified Query Filters\nUp until now, Bevy's Query filters were intermingled with components:\nfn system(query: Query&lt;With&lt;A, Without&lt;B, (&amp;Transform, Changed&lt;Velocity&gt;)&gt;&gt;&gt;) {\n}\n\nConfused? You wouldn't be the first! You can interpret the query above as \"give me immutable references to the Transform and Velocity components of all entities that have the A component, do not have the B component, and have a changed Velocity component\".\nFirst, the nesting of types via With / Without makes it very unclear whats going on. Additionally, it's hard to tell what the Changed&lt;Velocity&gt; parameter does. Is it just a filter? Does it also return a Velocity component? If so, is it immutable or mutable?\nIt made sense to break up these concepts. In Bevy 0.4, Query filters are separate from Query components. The query above looks like this:\n// Query with filters\nfn system(query: Query&lt;(&amp;Transform, &amp;Velocity), (With&lt;A&gt;, Without&lt;B&gt;, Changed&lt;Velocity&gt;)&gt;) {\n}\n\n// Query without filters\nfn system(query: Query&lt;(&amp;Transform, &amp;Velocity)&gt;) {\n}\n\nThis makes it much easier to tell what a Query is doing at a glance. It also makes for more composable behaviors. For example, you can now filter on Changed&lt;Velocity&gt; without actually retrieving the Velocity component.\nAnd now that filters are a separate type, you can create type aliases for filters that you want to re-use:\ntype ChangedVelocity = (With&lt;A&gt;, Without&lt;B&gt;, Changed&lt;Velocity&gt;);\n\nfn system(query: Query&lt;(&amp;Transform, &amp;Velocity), ChangedVelocity&gt;) {\n}\nSystem Inputs, Outputs, and Chaining\nSystems can now have inputs and outputs. This opens up a variety of interesting behaviors, such as system error handling:\nfn main() {\n  App::build()\n    .add_system(result_system.system().chain(error_handler.system()))\n    .run();\n}\n\nfn result_system(query: Query&lt;&amp;Transform&gt;) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt; {\n  let transform = query.get(SOME_ENTITY)?;\n  println!(\"found entity transform: {:?}\", transform);\n  Ok(())\n}\n\nfn error_handler_system(In(result): In&lt;Result&lt;()&gt;&gt;, error_handler: Res&lt;MyErrorHandler&gt;) {\n  if let Err(err) = result {\n      error_handler.handle_error(err);\n  }\n}\n\nThe System\n trait now looks like this:\n// Has no inputs and no outputs\nSystem&lt;In = (), Out = ()&gt;\n\n// Takes a usize as input and return a f32\nSystem&lt;In = usize, Out = f32&gt;\n\nWe use this feature in our new Schedule implementation.\nSchedule V2\nBevy's old Schedule was nice. System registrations were easy to read and easy to compose. But it also had significant limitations:\n\nOnly one Schedule allowed\nVery static: you were limited to using the tools we gave you:\n\nstages are just lists of systems\nstages are added to schedules\nstages use hard-coded system runners\n\n\nCouldn't switch between schedules at runtime\nCouldn't easily support \"fixed timestep\" scenarios\n\nTo solve these problems, I wrote a new Schedule system from scratch. Before you get worried, these are largely non-breaking changes. The high level \"app builder\" syntax you know and love is still available:\napp.add_system(my_system.system())\nStage Trait\nStages are now a trait. You can now implement your own Stage\n types!\nstruct MyStage;\n\nimpl Stage for MyStage {\n    fn run(&amp;mut self, world: &amp;mut World, resources: &amp;mut Resources) {\n        // Do stage stuff here.\n        // You have unique access to the World and Resources, so you are free to do anything\n    }\n}\nStage Type: SystemStage\n\nThis is basically a \"normal\" stage. You can add systems to it and you can decide how those systems will be executed (parallel, serial, or custom logic)\n// runs systems in parallel (using the default parallel executor)\nlet parallel_stage =\n    SystemStage::parallel()\n        .with_system(a.system())\n        .with_system(b.system());\n\n// runs systems serially (in registration order)\nlet serial_stage =\n    SystemStage::serial()\n        .with_system(a.system())\n        .with_system(b.system());\n\n// you can also write your own custom SystemStageExecutor\nlet custom_executor_stage =\n    SystemStage::new(MyCustomExecutor::new())\n        .with_system(a.system())\n        .with_system(b.system());\nStage Type: Schedule\n\nYou read that right! Schedule\n now implements the Stage\n trait, which means you can nest Schedules within other schedules:\nlet schedule = Schedule::default()\n    .with_stage(\"update\", SystemStage::parallel()\n        .with_system(a.system())\n        .with_system(b.system())\n    )\n    .with_stage(\"nested\", Schedule::default()\n        .with_stage(\"nested_stage\", SystemStage::serial()\n            .with_system(b.system())\n        )\n    );\nRun Criteria\nYou can add \"run criteria\" to any SystemStage\n or Schedule\n.\n// A \"run criteria\" is just a system that returns a `ShouldRun` result\nfn only_on_10_criteria(value: Res&lt;usize&gt;) -&gt; ShouldRun {\n    if *value == 10 { \n        ShouldRun::Yes \n    } else { \n        ShouldRun::No\n    }\n}\n\napp\n    // this stage only runs when Res&lt;usize&gt; has a value of 10\n    .add_stage_after(stage::UPDATE, \"only_on_10_stage\", SystemStage::parallel()\n        .with_run_criteria(only_on_10_criteria.system())\n        .with_system(my_system.system())\n    )\n    // this stage only runs once\n    .add_stage_after(stage::RUN_ONCE, \"one_and_done\", Schedule::default()\n        .with_run_criteria(RunOnce::default())\n        .with_system(my_system.system())\n    )\nFixed Timestep\nYou can now run stages on a \"fixed timestep\".\n// this stage will run once every 0.4 seconds\napp.add_stage_after(stage::UPDATE, \"fixed_update\", SystemStage::parallel()\n    .with_run_criteria(FixedTimestep::step(0.4))\n    .with_system(my_system.system())\n)\n\nThis builds on top of ShouldRun::YesAndLoop, which ensures that the schedule continues to loop until it has consumed all accumulated time.\nCheck out the excellent \"Fix Your Timestep!\" article if you want to learn more about fixed timesteps.\nTyped Stage Builders\nNow that stages can be any type, we need a way for Plugins\n to interact with arbitrary stage types:\napp\n    // this \"high level\" builder pattern still works (and assumes that the stage is a SystemStage)\n    .add_system(some_system.system())\n    // this \"low level\" builder is equivalent to add_system()\n    .stage(stage::UPDATE, |stage: &amp;mut SystemStage|\n        stage.add_system(some_system.system())\n    )\n    // this works for custom stage types too\n    .stage(MY_CUSTOM_STAGE, |stage: &amp;mut MyCustomStage|\n        stage.do_custom_thing()\n    )\nDeprecated For-Each Systems\nPrior versions of Bevy supported \"for-each\" systems, which looked like this:\n// on each update this system runs once for each entity with a Transform component\nfn system(time: Res&lt;Time&gt;, entity: Entity, transform: Mut&lt;Transform&gt;) {\n    // do per-entity logic here\n}\n\nFrom now on, the system above should be written like this:\n// on each update this system runs once and internally iterates over each entity\nfn system(time: Res&lt;Time&gt;, query: Query&lt;(Entity, &amp;mut Transform)&gt;) {\n    for (entity, mut transform) in query.iter_mut() {\n        // do per-entity logic here\n    }\n}\n\nFor-each systems were nice to look at and sometimes saved some typing. Why remove them?\n\nFor-each systems were fundamentally limited in a number of ways. They couldn't iterate removed components, filter, control iteration, or use multiple queries at the same time. This meant they needed to be converted to \"query systems\" as soon as those features were needed.\nBevy should generally have \"one way to do things\". For-each systems were a slightly more ergonomic way to define a small subset of system types. This forced people to make a \"design decision\" when they shouldn't need to. It also made examples and tutorials inconsistent according to people's preferences for one or the other.\nThere were a number of \"gotchas\" for newcomers that constantly come up in our support forums and confused newbies:\n\nusers expect &amp;mut T queries to work in foreach systems (ex: fn system(a: &amp;mut A) {}). These can't work because we require Mut&lt;T&gt; tracking pointers to ensure change tracking always works as expected. The equivalent Query&lt;&amp;mut A&gt; works because we can return the tracking pointer when iterating the Query.\nA \"run this for-each system on some criteria\" bug that was common enough that we had to cover it in the Bevy Book.\n\n\nThey increased compile times. Removing for-each systems saved me about ~5 seconds on clean Bevy compiles)\nTheir internal implementation required a complicated macro. This affected maintainability.\n\nStates\nauthors: @cart\nBy popular demand, Bevy now supports States. These are logical \"app states\" that allow you to enable/disable systems according to the state your app is in.\nStates are defined as normal Rust enums:\n#[derive(Clone)]\nenum AppState {\n    Loading,\n    Menu,\n    InGame\n}\n\nYou then add them to your app as a resource like this:\n// add a new AppState resource that defaults to the Loading state\napp.add_resource(State::new(AppState::Loading))\n\nTo run systems according to the current state, add a StateStage\n:\napp.add_stage_after(stage::UPDATE, STAGE, StateStage::&lt;AppState&gt;::default())\n\nYou can then add systems for each state value / lifecycle-event like this:\napp\n    .on_state_enter(STAGE, AppState::Menu, setup_menu.system())\n    .on_state_update(STAGE, AppState::Menu, menu.system())\n    .on_state_exit(STAGE, AppState::Menu, cleanup_menu.system())\n    .on_state_enter(STAGE, AppState::InGame, setup_game.system())\n    .on_state_update(STAGE, AppState::InGame, movement.system())\n\nNotice that there are different \"lifecycle events\":\n\non_enter: Runs once when first entering a state\non_exit: Runs once when exiting a state\non_update: Runs exactly once on every run of the stage (after any on_enter or on_exit events have been run)\n\nYou can queue a state change from a system like this:\nfn system(mut state: ResMut&lt;State&lt;AppState&gt;&gt;) {\n    state.set_next(AppState::InGame).unwrap();\n}\n\nQueued state changes get applied at the end of the StateStage. If you change state within a StateStage, the lifecycle events will occur in the same update/frame. You can do this any number of times (aka it will continue running state lifecycle systems until no more changes are queued). This ensures that multiple state changes can be applied within the same frame.\nGLTF Improvements\nauthors: @iwikal, @FuriouZz, @rod-salazar\nBevy's GLTF loader now imports Cameras. Here is a simple scene setup in Blender:\n\nAnd here is how it looks in Bevy (the lighting is different because we don't import lights yet):\n\nThere were also a number of other improvements:\n\nPixel format conversion while importing images from a GLTF\nDefault material loading\nHierarchy fixes\n\nSpawn Scenes as Children\nauthors: @mockersf\nScenes can now be spawned as children like this:\ncommands\n    .spawn((\n        Transform::from_translation(Vec3::new(0.5, 0.0, 0.0)),\n        GlobalTransform::default(),\n    ))\n    .with_children(|parent| {\n        parent.spawn_scene(asset_server.load(\"scene.gltf\"));\n    });\n\nBy spawning beneath a parent, this enables you to do things like translate/rotate/scale multiple instances of the same scene:\n\nDynamic Linking\nauthors: @bjorn3, @cart\n@bjorn3 discovered that you can force Bevy to dynamically link.\nThis significantly reduces iterative compile times. Check out how long it takes to compile a change made to the 3d_scene.rs example with the Fast Compiles Config and dynamic linking:\n\nTime To Compile Change To 3d_scene Example (in seconds, less is better)\n\nWe added a cargo feature to easily enable dynamic linking during development\n# for a bevy app\ncargo run --features bevy/dynamic\n\n# for bevy examples\ncargo run --features dynamic --example breakout\n\nJust keep in mind that you should disable the feature when publishing your game.\nText Layout Improvements\nauthors: @AlisCode, @tigregalis\nPrior Bevy releases used a custom, naive text layout system. It had a number of bugs and limitations, such as the infamous \"wavy text\" bug:\n\nThe new text layout system uses glyph_brush_layout, which fixes the layout bugs and adds a number of new layout options. Note that the \"Fira Sans\" font used in the example has some stylistic \"waviness\" ... this isn't a bug:\n\nRenderer Optimization\nauthors: @cart\nBevy's render api was built to be easy to use and extend. I wanted to nail down a good api first, but that resulted in a number of performance TODOs that caused some pretty serious overhead.\nFor Bevy 0.4 I decided to resolve as many of those TODOs as I could. There is still plenty more to do (like instancing and batching), but Bevy already performs much better than it did before.\nIncrementalize Everything\nMost of Bevy's high level render abstractions were designed to be incrementally updated, but when I was first building the engine, ECS change detection wasn't implemented. Now that we have all of these nice optimization tools, it makes sense to use them!\nFor the first optimization round, I incrementalized as much as I could:\n\nAdded change detection to RenderResourceNode, Sprites, and Transforms, which improved performance when those values don't change\nOnly sync asset gpu data when the asset changes\nShare asset RenderResourceBindings across all entities that reference an asset\nMesh provider system now only updates mesh specialization when it needs to\nStop clearing bind groups every frame and remove stale bind groups every other frame\nCache unmatched render resource binding results (which prevents redundant computations per-entity per-frame)\nDon't send render pass state change commands when the state has not actually changed\n\nFrame Time to Draw 10,000 Static Sprites (in milliseconds, less is better)\n\nFrame Time to Draw 10,000 Moving Sprites (in milliseconds, less is better)\n\nOptimize Text Rendering (and other immediate rendering)\nText Rendering (and anything else that used the SharedBuffers immediate-rendering abstraction) was extremely slow in prior Bevy releases. This was because the SharedBuffers abstraction was a placeholder implementation that didn't actually share buffers. By implementing the \"real\" SharedBuffers abstraction, we got a pretty significant text rendering speed boost.\nFrame Time to Draw \"text_debug\" Example  (in milliseconds, less is better)\n\nMailbox Vsync\nBevy now uses wgpu's \"mailbox vsync\" by default. This reduces input latency on platforms that support it.\nReflection\nauthors: @cart\nRust has a pretty big \"reflection\" gap. For those who aren't aware, \"reflection\" is a class of language feature that enables you to interact with language constructs at runtime. They add a form of \"dynamic-ness\" to what are traditionally static language concepts. \nWe have bits and pieces of reflection in Rust, such as std::any::TypeId\n and std::any::type_name\n. But when it comes to interacting with datatypes ... we don't have anything yet. This is unfortunate because some problems are inherently dynamic in nature.\nWhen I was first building Bevy, I decided that the engine would benefit from such features. Reflection is a good foundation for scene systems, Godot-like (or Unity-like) property animation systems, and editor inspection tools. I built the bevy_property and bevy_type_registry crates to fill these needs.\nThey got the job done, but they were custom-tailored to Bevy's needs, were full of custom jargon (rather than reflecting Rust language constructs directly), didn't handle traits, and had a number of fundamental restrictions on how data could be accessed. \nIn this release we replaced the old bevy_property and bevy_type_registry crates with a new bevy_reflect crate. Bevy Reflect is intended to be a \"generic\" Rust reflection crate. I'm hoping it will be as useful for non-Bevy projects as it is for Bevy. We now use it for our Scene system, but in the future we will use it for animating Component fields and auto-generating Bevy Editor inspector widgets.\nBevy Reflect enables you to dynamically interact with Rust types by deriving the Reflect\n trait:\n#[derive(Reflect)]\nstruct Foo {\n    a: u32,\n    b: Vec&lt;Bar&gt;,\n    c: Vec&lt;u32&gt;,\n}\n\n#[derive(Reflect)]\nstruct Bar {\n    value: String\n}\n\n// I'll use this value to illustrate `bevy_reflect` features\nlet mut foo = Foo {\n    a: 1,\n    b: vec![Bar { value: \"hello world\" }]\n    c: vec![1, 2]\n};\nInteract with Fields Using Their Names\nassert_eq!(*foo.get_field::&lt;u32&gt;(\"a\").unwrap(), 1);\n\n*foo.get_field_mut::&lt;u32&gt;(\"a\").unwrap() = 2;\n\nassert_eq!(foo.a, 2);\nPatch Your Types With New Values\nlet mut dynamic_struct = DynamicStruct::default();\ndynamic_struct.insert(\"a\", 42u32);\ndynamic_struct.insert(\"c\", vec![3, 4, 5]);\n\nfoo.apply(&amp;dynamic_struct);\n\nassert_eq!(foo.a, 42);\nassert_eq!(foo.c, vec![3, 4, 5]);\nLook Up Nested Fields Using \"Path Strings\"\nlet value = *foo.get_path::&lt;String&gt;(\"b[0].value\").unwrap();\nassert_eq!(value.as_str(), \"hello world\");\nIterate Over Struct Fields\nfor (i, value: &amp;Reflect) in foo.iter_fields().enumerate() {\n    let field_name = foo.name_at(i).unwrap();\n    if let Ok(value) = value.downcast_ref::&lt;u32&gt;() {\n        println!(\"{} is a u32 with the value: {}\", field_name, *value);\n    } \n}\nAutomatically Serialize And Deserialize With Serde\nThis doesn't require manual Serde impls!\nlet mut registry = TypeRegistry::default();\nregistry.register::&lt;u32&gt;();\nregistry.register::&lt;String&gt;();\nregistry.register::&lt;Bar&gt;();\n\nlet serializer = ReflectSerializer::new(&amp;foo, &amp;registry);\nlet serialized = ron::ser::to_string_pretty(&amp;serializer, ron::ser::PrettyConfig::default()).unwrap();\n\nlet mut deserializer = ron::de::Deserializer::from_str(&amp;serialized).unwrap();\nlet reflect_deserializer = ReflectDeserializer::new(&amp;registry);\nlet value = reflect_deserializer.deserialize(&amp;mut deserializer).unwrap();\nlet dynamic_struct = value.take::&lt;DynamicStruct&gt;().unwrap();\n\n/// reflect has its own partal_eq impl\nassert!(foo.reflect_partial_eq(&amp;dynamic_struct).unwrap());\nTrait Reflection\nYou can now call a trait on a given &amp;dyn Reflect reference without knowing the underlying type! This is a form of magic that should probably be avoided in most situations. But in the few cases where it is completely necessary, it is very useful:\n#[derive(Reflect)]\n#[reflect(DoThing)]\nstruct MyType {\n    value: String,\n}\n\nimpl DoThing for MyType {\n    fn do_thing(&amp;self) -&gt; String {\n        format!(\"{} World!\", self.value)\n    }\n}\n\n#[reflect_trait]\npub trait DoThing {\n    fn do_thing(&amp;self) -&gt; String;\n}\n\n// First, lets box our type as a Box&lt;dyn Reflect&gt;\nlet reflect_value: Box&lt;dyn Reflect&gt; = Box::new(MyType {\n    value: \"Hello\".to_string(),\n});\n\n/* \nThis means we no longer have direct access to MyType or it methods. We can only call Reflect methods on reflect_value. What if we want to call `do_thing` on our type? We could downcast using reflect_value.get::&lt;MyType&gt;(), but what if we don't know the type at compile time?\n*/\n\n// Normally in rust we would be out of luck at this point. Lets use our new reflection powers to do something cool!\nlet mut type_registry = TypeRegistry::default()\ntype_registry.register::&lt;MyType&gt;();\n\n/*\nThe #[reflect] attribute we put on our DoThing trait generated a new `ReflectDoThing` struct, which implements TypeData. This was added to MyType's TypeRegistration.\n*/\n\nlet reflect_do_thing = type_registry\n    .get_type_data::&lt;ReflectDoThing&gt;(reflect_value.type_id())\n    .unwrap();\n\n// We can use this generated type to convert our `&amp;dyn Reflect` reference to an `&amp;dyn DoThing` reference\nlet my_trait: &amp;dyn DoThing = reflect_do_thing.get(&amp;*reflect_value).unwrap();\n\n// Which means we can now call do_thing(). Magic!\nprintln!(\"{}\", my_trait.do_thing());\n3D Texture Assets\nauthors: @bonsairobo\nThe Texture asset now has support for 3D textures. The new array_texture.rs example illustrates how to load a 3d texture and sample from each \"layer\".\n\nLogging and Profiling\nauthors: @superdump, @cart\nBevy finally has built in logging, which is now enabled by default via the new LogPlugin\n. We evaluated various logging libraries and eventually landed on the new tracing crate. tracing is a structured logger that handles async / parallel logging well (perfect for an engine like Bevy), and enables profiling in addition to \"normal\" logging.\nThe LogPlugin\n configures each platform to log to the appropriate backend by default: the terminal on desktop, the console on web, and Android Logs / logcat on Android. We built a new Android tracing backend because one didn't exist yet.\nLogging\nBevy's internal plugins now generate tracing logs. And you can easily add logs to your own app logic like this:\n// these are imported by default in bevy::prelude::*\ntrace!(\"very noisy\");\ndebug!(\"helpful for debugging\");\ninfo!(\"helpful information that is worth printing by default\");\nwarn!(\"something bad happened that isn't a failure, but thats worth calling out\");\nerror!(\"something failed\");\n\nThese lines result in pretty-printed terminal logs:\n\ntracing has a ton of useful features like structured logging and filtering. Check out their documentation for more info.\nProfiling\nWe have added the option to add \"tracing spans\" to all ECS systems by enabling the trace feature. We also have built in support for the tracing-chrome extension, which causes Bevy to output traces in the \"chrome tracing\" format.\nIf you run your app with cargo run --features bevy/trace,bevy/trace_chrome you will get a json file which can be opened in Chrome browsers by visiting the chrome://tracing url:\n\n@superdump added support for those nice \"span names\" to upstream tracing_chrome.\nHIDPI\nauthors: @mockersf, @blunted2night, @cart\nBevy now handles HIDPI / Retina / high pixel density displays properly:\n\nOS-reported pixel density is now taken into account when creating windows. If a Bevy App asks for a 1280x720 window on a 2x pixel density display, it will create a window that is 2560x1440\nWindow width/height is now reported in \"logical units\" (1280x720 in the example above). Physical units are still available using the window.physical_width() and window.physical_height() methods.\nWindow \"swap chains\" are created using the physical resolution to ensure we still have crisp rendering (2560x1440 in the example above) \nBevy UI has been adapted to handle HIDPI scaling correctly\n\nThere is still a bit more work to be done here. While Bevy UI renders images and boxes at crisp HIDPI resolutions, text is still rendered using the logical resolution, which means it won't be as crisp as it could be on HIDPI displays.\nTimer Improvements\nauthors: @amberkowalski, @marcusbuffett, @CleanCut\nBevy's Timer component/resource got a number of quality-of-life improvements: pausing, field accessor methods, ergonomics improvements, and internal refactoring / code quality improvements. Timer Components also no longer tick by default. Timer resources and newtyped Timer components couldn't tick by default, so it was a bit inconsistent to have the (relatively uncommon) \"unwrapped component Timer\" auto-tick.\nThe timer api now looks like this:\n\nstruct MyTimer {\n    timer: Timer,\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    App::build()\n        .add_resource(MyTimer {\n            // a five second non-repeating timer\n            timer: Timer::from_seconds(5.0, false),\n        })\n        .add_system(timer_system.system())\n        .run();\n}\n\n\nfn timer_system(time: Res&lt;Time&gt;, my_timer: ResMut&lt;MyTimer&gt;) {\n    if my_timer.timer.tick(time.delta_seconds()).just_finished() {\n        println!(\"five seconds have passed\");\n    }\n}\nTask System Improvements\nauthors: @aclysma\n@aclysma changed how Bevy Tasks schedules work, which increased performance in the breakout.rs example game by ~20% and resolved a deadlock when a Task Pool is configured to only have one thread. Tasks are now executed on the calling thread immediately when there is only one task to run, which cuts down on the overhead of moving work to other threads / blocking on them to finish.\nApple Silicon Support\nauthors: @frewsxcv, @wyhaya, @scoopr\nBevy now runs on Apple silicon thanks to upstream work on winit (@scoopr) and coreaudio-sys (@wyhaya). @frewsxcv and @wyhaya updated Bevy's dependencies and verified that it builds/runs on Apple's new chips.\nNew Examples\nContributors\nauthor: @karroffel\n@karroffel added a fun example that represents each Bevy contributor as a \"Bevy Bird\". It scrapes the latest contributor list from git.\n\nBevyMark\nauthor: @robdavenport\nA \"bunnymark-style\" benchmark illustrating Bevy's sprite rendering performance. This was useful when implementing the renderer optimizations mentioned above.\n\nChange Log\nAdded\n\nadd bevymark benchmark example\ngltf: support camera and fix hierarchy \nAdd tracing spans to schedules, stages, systems\nadd example that represents contributors as bevy icons\nAdd received character\nAdd bevy_dylib to force dynamic linking of bevy \nAdded RenderPass::set_scissor_rect\nbevy_log\n\nAdds logging functionality as a Plugin.\nChanges internal logging to work with the new implementation.\n\n\ncross-platform main function\nControllable ambient light color\n\nAdded a resource to change the current ambient light color for PBR.\n\n\nAdded more basic color constants\nAdd box shape\nExpose an EventId for events\nSystem Inputs, Outputs, and Chaining\nExpose an EventId for events\nAdded set_cursor_position to Window\nAdded new Bevy reflection system\n\nReplaces the properties system\n\n\nAdd support for Apple Silicon\nLive reloading of shaders\n Store mouse cursor position in Window\nAdd removal_detection example\nAdditional vertex attribute value types\nAdded WindowFocused event\nTracing chrome span names\nAllow windows to be maximized\nGLTF: load default material\ncan spawn a scene from a ChildBuilder, or directly set its parent when spawning it\nadd ability to load .dds, .tga, and .jpeg texture formats\nadd ability to provide custom a AssetIo implementation\n\nChanged\n\ndelegate layout reflection to RenderResourceContext \nFall back to remove components one by one when failing to remove a bundle\nPort hecs derive macro improvements \nUse glyph_brush_layout and add text alignment support\nupgrade glam and hexasphere\nFlexible ECS Params\nMake Timer.tick return &amp;Self\nFileAssetIo includes full path on error\nRemoved ECS query APIs that could easily violate safety from the public interface\nChanged Query filter API to be easier to understand\nbevy_render: delegate buffer aligning to render_resource_context\nwasm32: non-spirv shader specialization\nRenamed XComponents to XBundle\nCheck for conflicting system resource parameters\nTweaks to TextureAtlasBuilder.finish()\ndo not spend time drawing text with is_visible = false\nExtend the Texture asset type to support 3D data\nBreaking changes to timer API\n\nCreated getters and setters rather than exposing struct members.\n\n\nRemoved timer auto-ticking system\n\nAdded an example of how to tick timers manually.\n\n\nWhen a task scope produces &lt;= 1 task to run, run it on the calling thread immediately\nBreaking changes to Time API\n\nCreated getters to get Time state and made members private.\nModifying Time's values directly is no longer possible outside of bevy.\n\n\nUse mailbox instead of fifo for vsync on supported systems\nswitch winit size to logical to be dpi independent\nChange bevy_input::Touch API to match similar APIs\nRun parent-update and transform-propagation during the \"post-startup\" stage (instead of \"startup\")\nRenderer Optimization Round 1\nChangeTextureAtlasBuilder into expected Builder conventions\nOptimize Text rendering / SharedBuffers\nhidpi swap chains\noptimize asset gpu data transfer\nnaming coherence for cameras\nSchedule v2\nUse shaderc for aarch64-apple-darwin\nupdate Window's width &amp;

It is free and open-source forever!\n\nIt has the following design goals:\n\nCapable: Offer a complete 2D and 3D feature set\nSimple: Easy for newbies to pick up, but infinitely flexible for power users\nData Focused: Data-oriented architecture using the Entity Component System paradigm \nModular: Use only what you need. Replace what you don't like\nFast: App logic should run quickly, and when possible, in parallel\nProductive: Changes should compile quickly ... waiting isn't fun\n\nBevy has a number of features that I think set it apart from other engines:\n\nBevy ECS: A custom Entity Component System with unrivaled usability and blisteringly-fast performance\nRender Graphs: Easily build your own multi-threaded render pipelines using Render Graph nodes\nBevy UI: A custom ECS-driven UI framework built specifically for Bevy\nProductive Compile Times: Expect changes to compile in ~0.8-3.0 seconds with the \"fast compiles\" config\n\nIt also has many features most people expect from a modern, general purpose engine:\n\nCross Platform: Windows, MacOS, and Linux (with planned support for mobile and web)\n3D: Lights, meshes, textures, MSAA, and GLTF loading\nSprites: Render individual images as sprites, render from sprite sheets, and dynamically generate new sprite sheets\nAssets: An extensible, event driven asset system that loads assets asynchronously in background threads\nScenes: Save ECS Worlds to human-readable scene files and load scene files into ECS Worlds\nPlugins: All engine and app features are implemented as modular plugins\nSound: Load audio files as assets and play them from within systems\nMultiple Render Backends: Vulkan, DirectX 12, and Metal (with more on the way thanks to wgpu)\nData Driven Shaders: Easily bind ECS components directly to shader uniforms\nHot Asset Reloading: Automatically reload changes to assets at runtime without recompiles or restarts\nEvents: Efficiently consume and produce Events from within ECS systems\nProperties: Dynamically get and set component fields using a string version of their names\nHierarchical Transforms: Create parent-child relationships between entities that propagate Transforms down the hierarchy \n\nThat being said, Bevy is still in the very early stages. I consider it to be in the \"prototyping\" phase: features are missing, APIs will change, and documentation is sparse. I don't yet recommend using Bevy in serious projects unless you are willing to deal with gaps and instability.\nHopefully at this point you are either (1) jazzed about Bevy or (2) not reading anymore. If you want to dive in right now, The Bevy Book is the best place to get started. You can also keep reading to find out what the current state of Bevy is and where we'd like to take it.\nQuick note to the reader: in this article you will find text formatted like this: Texture\n\nThis formatting indicates that the text is a Rust type that links to API documentation. I encourage you to click on anything that seems interesting to you!\nBevy Apps\nFirst, lets see what a Bevy App actually looks like. The simplest App looks like this:\nuse bevy::prelude::*;\n\nfn main() {\n    App::build().run();\n}\n\nThats it! This App pulls in no features and literally does nothing. Running the program would just immediately terminate. We can make it a little more interesting by doing this:\nfn main() {\n    App::build()\n        .add_default_plugins()\n        .run();\n}\nadd_default_plugins()\n adds all of the features you probably expect from a game engine: a 2D / 3D renderer, asset loading, a UI system, windows, input, etc\nYou can also register the default Plugins\n manually like this:\nfn main() {\n    App::build()\n        .add_plugin(CorePlugin::default())\n        .add_plugin(InputPlugin::default())\n        .add_plugin(WindowPlugin::default())\n        .add_plugin(RenderPlugin::default())\n        .add_plugin(UiPlugin::default())\n        /* more plugins here ... omitted for brevity */\n        .run();\n}\n\nAnd of course you can also create your own plugins. In fact, all engine and game logic is built using plugins. Hopefully now you understand what we mean by modular: you are free to add/remove plugins based on your project's unique needs. However I expect that most people will stick to add_default_plugins()\n for simplicity, at least initially.\nBevy ECS\nAll Bevy engine and game logic is built on top of a custom Entity Component System (or ECS for short). Entity Component Systems are a software paradigm that involves breaking data up into Components. Entities are unique ids assigned to groups of Components. For example, one entity might might have a Position and Velocity component, whereas another entity might have a Position and UI component. Systems are logic that runs on a specific set of component types. You might have a movement system that runs on all entities with a Position and Velocity component.\nThe ECS pattern encourages clean, decoupled designs by forcing you to break up your app data and logic into its core components.\nUnlike other Rust ECS implementations, which require complex lifetimes, traits, builder patterns, or macros, Bevy ECS uses normal Rust datatypes for all of these concepts:\n\nComponents: normal Rust structs\nSystems: normal Rust functions\nEntities: a type containing a unique integer\n\nThere are already plenty of great introductions to the ECS paradigm, so I'll leave \"getting up to speed on ECS\" as an exercise for the reader and skip right to what makes Bevy's ECS so special:\nErgonomics\nI'm going to make a wild (and unverifiable) claim here: Bevy ECS is the most ergonomic ECS in existence:\nuse bevy::prelude::*;\n\nstruct Velocity(f32);\nstruct Position(f32);\n\n// this system spawns entities with the Position and Velocity components\nfn setup(mut commands: Commands) {\n    commands\n        .spawn((Position(0.0), Velocity(1.0),))\n        .spawn((Position(1.0), Velocity(2.0),));\n}\n\n// this system runs on each entity with a Position and Velocity component\nfn movement(mut position: Mut&lt;Position&gt;, velocity: &amp;Velocity) {\n    position.0 += velocity.0;\n}\n\n// the app entry point. hopefully you recognize it from the examples above!\nfn main() {\n    App::build()\n        .add_default_plugins()\n        .add_startup_system(setup.system())\n        .add_system(movement.system())\n        .run();\n}\n\nThat is a complete self-contained Bevy app with automatic parallel system scheduling and global change detection. In my opinion, you won't find any ECS with better clarity or ergonomics. Building games (and engines) involves writing a large number of systems, so I heavily invested in making ECS code easy to write and easy to read.\nPerformance\nOne of the reasons the ECS paradigm is so popular is that it has the potential to make game logic super fast, primarily for these two reasons:\n\nIteration Speed: Components are packed tightly together to optimize for cache-locality, which makes iterating over them blazing fast\nParallelism: Systems declare read/write dependencies, which enables automatic and efficient lock-free parallel scheduling\n\nBevy ECS does both of these things about as well as it can. According to the popular ecs_bench benchmark, Bevy ECS is the fastest Rust ECS by a pretty wide margin:\nSystem Iteration (in nanoseconds, less is better)\n\nWorld Setup (in nanoseconds, less is better)\n\nNote that ecs_bench is a single threaded benchmark, so it doesn't illustrate the multi-threading capabilities of these framework. And as always, please be aware that ecs_bench is a micro benchmark and it doesn't illustrate the performance of a complex game. There is a lot of nuance in the ECS performance space and each of the ECS implementations above will perform differently under different workloads. \nI have pushed my version of ecs_bench here if anyone wants to double-check my methodology. For some reasonable amount of time I will post updates here if anyone reports a problem or my results are not (on average) reproducible.\nFeatures\nNow you might be thinking \"Ok @cart, so Bevy ECS has great performance and ergonomics, but surely this means you had to compromise on features!\"\n... NOPE Bevy has you covered:\nFor Each Systems\n// \"for each systems\" run once on each entity containing the given components\nfn system(position: Mut&lt;Position&gt;, velocity: &amp;Velocity) {\n    // do something\n}\nQuery Systems\n// this \"query system\" is the same as the system above, but gives you control over iteration\nfn system(mut query: Query&lt;(&amp;Position, &amp;mut Velocity)&gt;) {\n    for (position, mut velocity) in &amp;mut query.iter() {\n        // do something\n    }\n}\nChange Detection\n// Added&lt;T&gt; queries only run when the given component has been added\nfn system(mut query: Query&lt;Added&lt;Position&gt;&gt;) {\n    for position in &amp;mut query.iter() {\n        // do something\n    }\n}\n\n// Mutated&lt;T&gt; queries only run when the given component has been mutated\nfn system(mut query: Query&lt;Mutated&lt;Position&gt;&gt;) {\n    for position in &amp;mut query.iter() {\n        // do something\n    }\n}\n\n// Changed&lt;T&gt; queries only run when the given component has been added or mutated\nfn system(mut query: Query&lt;Changed&lt;Position&gt;&gt;) {\n    for position in &amp;mut query.iter() {\n        // do something\n    }\n}\n\n// query.removed&lt;T&gt;() will iterate over every entity where the component T was removed this update\nfn system(mut query: Query&lt;&amp;Position&gt;&gt;) {\n    for entity in query.removed::&lt;Velocity&gt;() {\n        // do something\n    }\n}\nMultiple Queries\nfn system(mut wall_query: Query&lt;&amp;Wall&gt;, mut player_query: Query&lt;&amp;Player&gt;) {\n    for player in &amp;mut player_query.iter() {\n        for wall in &amp;mut wall_query.iter() {\n            if player.collides_with(wall) {\n                println!(\"ouch\");\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\nEntity Queries and Direct Component Access\nfn system(mut entity_query: Query&lt;Entity&gt;, mut player_query: Query&lt;&amp;Player&gt;) {\n    for entity in &amp;mut entity_query.iter() {\n       if let Some(player) = player_query.get::&lt;Player&gt;(entity) {\n           // the current entity has a player component\n       }\n    }\n}\nResources\n// Res and ResMut access global resources \nfn system(time: Res&lt;Time&gt;, score: ResMut&lt;Score&gt;) {\n    // do something\n}\n\n// you can use Resources in any system type\nfn system(time: Res&lt;Time&gt;, mut query: Query&lt;&amp;Position&gt;) {\n    // do something\n}\nfn system(time: Res&lt;Time&gt;, &amp;Position) {\n    // do something\n}\n\"Local\" System Resources\n// Local&lt;T&gt; resources are unique per-system. Two instances of the same system will each have their own resource. Local resources are automatically initialized to their default value.\nfn system(state: Local&lt;State&gt;, &amp;Position) {\n    // do something\n}\nEmpty Systems\n// for the hyper-minimalists\nfn system() {\n    // do something\n}\nWith/Without Filters\n// only runs on entities With or Without a given component\nfn system(mut query: Query&lt;Without&lt;Parent, &amp;Position&gt;&gt;) {\n    for position in &amp;mut query.iter() {\n        // do something\n    }\n}\nThread-Local Systems\n// systems that must run on the main thread with exclusive access to World and Resources\nfn system(world: &amp;mut World, resources: &amp;mut Resources) {\n    // do something\n}\nStages\n// the scheduler provides Stages as a way to run sets of systems in order  \nfn main() {\n    App::build()\n        // adds a system to the default stage: \"update\" \n        .add_system(movement.system())\n        // creates a new stage after \"update\"\n        .add_stage_after(\"update\", \"do_things\")\n        .add_system_to_stage(\"do_things\", something.system())\n}\nCommands\n// use Commands to queue up World and Resource changes, which will be applied at the end of the current Stage\nfn system(mut commands: Commands) {\n    commands.spawn((Position(0.0), Velocity(1.0)));\n}\n\n// Commands can also be used alongside other types\nfn system(mut commands: Commands, time: Res&lt;Time&gt;, mut query: Query&lt;&amp;Position&gt;) {\n    // do something\n}\nHow Do Function Systems Work?\nBeing able to use Rust functions directly as systems might feel like magic, but I promise it's not! You may have noticed that we do this when registering systems in our App:\nfn some_system() { }\n\nfn main() {\n    App::build()\n        .add_system(some_system.system())\n        .run();\n}\n\nThe .system() call takes the some_system function pointer and converts it to a Box&lt;dyn System&gt;. This works because we implement the IntoQuerySystem\n trait for all functions that match a certain set of function signatures.\nGood Bones\nBevy ECS actually uses a heavily forked version of the minimalist Hecs ECS. Hecs is an efficient single-threaded archetypal ECS. It provides the core World\n, Archetype\n, and internal Query\n data structures. Bevy ECS adds the following on top:\n\nFunction Systems: Hecs actually has no concept of a \"system\" at all. You just run queries directly on the World. Bevy adds the ability to define portable, schedulable systems using normal Rust functions.\nResources: Hecs has no concept of unique/global data. When building games, this is often needed. Bevy adds a Resource collection and resource queries\nParallel Scheduler: Hecs is single threaded, but it was designed to allow parallel schedulers to be built on top. Bevy ECS adds a custom dependency-aware scheduler that builds on top of the \"Function Systems\" mentioned above.\nOptimization: Hecs is already plenty fast, but by modifying some of its internal data access patterns, we were able to improve performance significantly. This moved it from \"fast enough\" to \"the fastest\" (see the benchmark above to compare Bevy ECS to vanilla Hecs).\nQuery Wrappers: The Query Bevy ECS exports is actually a wrapper around Hecs Queries. It provides safe, scoped access to the World in a multi-threaded context and improves the ergonomics of iteration.\nChange Detection: Automatically (and efficiently) tracks component add/remove/update operations and exposes them in the Query interface.\nStable Entity IDs: Almost every ECS (including Hecs) uses unstable entity ids that cannot be used for serialization (scenes / save files) or networking. In Bevy ECS, entity ids are globally unique and stable. You can use them in any context!\n\nIn the near future I will file an issue on the Hecs git repo offering to upstream whatever changes they want from Bevy ECS. I have a feeling they won't want the \"high level\" stuff like function systems and parallel scheduling, but I guess we'll see! \nBevy UI\n\nBevy has a custom, but familiar UI system based on the \"flex box\" model. Well... semi-custom, but more on that later. In the beginning, I heavily considered using one of the many great pre-made UI solutions in the Rust ecosystem. But each of these frameworks felt in some way \"separate\" from the data-driven ECS approach at the core of Bevy. If we took a framework like Druid, which is top-of-its class in terms of design, and then shoe-horned it into the Bevy data / event model, that would compromise the Druid design and Bevy+Druid would end up being less compelling than just using Druid as a standalone framework.\nI decided that the only way Bevy could even hope to bring something compelling to the table was to fully embrace the Bevy way of doing things.\nBevy UI directly uses the existing ECS, hierarchy, transform, event, asset, and scene systems at the core of Bevy. Because of this, Bevy UI automatically gets features like hot-reloading of UI scene files, async texture loading, and change detection. A shared architecture means that improvements to any of these systems feed directly into Bevy UI. I am not yet convinced that this approach will produce the best UI framework, but I am convinced that it will produce the best UI framework in the context of a Bevy App.\nWe are still in the experimental stages and I expect some things to change, but the patterns we've found so far are very promising. Also keep in mind that currently the best way to compose Bevy UIs is with code, but we are in the process of designing a new file format for scenes that should make declarative, file based UI composition much nicer than it currently is.\nBuilding Blocks\nIn Bevy, a UI element is just an ECS Entity with a Node\n component. Nodes are rectangles with a width and height, and are positioned using the same Transform\n component used elsewhere in Bevy. The Style\n component is used to determine how the Node is rendered, sized, and positioned.\nThe easiest way to add a new node (with all of the required components) is like this:\ncommands.spawn(NodeComponents::default())\nNodeComponents\n is a \"component bundle\", which Bevy uses to make spawning entities of various \"types\" easier.\nLayout\nFor layout, Bevy uses a fantastic 100% Rust flexbox implementation called Stretch. Stretch provides the algorithms for positioning rectangles in 2D space according to the flexbox spec. Bevy exposes flex properties inside the Style\n component mentioned above and renders rectangles with the positions and sizes that Stretch outputs. Bevy uses its own z-layering algorithm to \"stack\" elements on top of each other, but its basically the same one that HTML/CSS uses.\nRelative Positioning\nNodes are positioned relative to each other by default:\n\ncommands\n    .spawn(NodeComponents {\n        style: Style {\n            size: Size::new(Val::Px(100.0), Val::Px(100.0)),\n            ..Default::default()\n        },\n        material: materials.add(Color::rgb(0.08, 0.08, 1.0).into()),\n        ..Default::default()\n    })\n    .spawn(NodeComponents {\n        style: Style {\n            size: Size::new(Val::Percent(40.0), Val::Percent(40.0)),\n            ..Default::default()\n        },\n        material: materials.add(Color::rgb(1.0, 0.08, 0.08).into()),\n        ..Default::default()\n    });\nAbsolute Positioning\nYou can \"absolutely\" position a Node relative to its parent's corners like this:\n\ncommands\n    .spawn(NodeComponents {\n        style: Style {\n            size: Size::new(Val::Percent(40.0), Val::Percent(40.0)),\n            position_type: PositionType::Absolute,\n            position: Rect {\n                top: Val::Px(10.0),\n                right: Val::Px(10.0),\n                ..Default::default()\n            },\n            ..Default::default()\n        },\n        material: materials.add(Color::rgb(0.08, 0.08, 1.0).into()),\n        ..Default::default()\n    });\nParenting\nJust like any other Entity, Nodes can have children. Children are positioned and scaled relative to their parent. By default, children will always appear in front of their parents.\n\ncommands\n    .spawn(NodeComponents {\n        style: Style {\n            size: Size::new(Val::Percent(60.0), Val::Percent(60.0)),\n            position_type: PositionType::Absolute,\n            position: Rect {\n                top: Val::Px(10.0),\n                right: Val::Px(10.0),\n                ..Default::default()\n            },\n            ..Default::default()\n        },\n        material: materials.add(Color::rgb(0.08, 0.08, 1.0).into()),\n        ..Default::default()\n    })\n    .with_children(|parent| {\n        parent\n            .spawn(NodeComponents {\n                style: Style {\n                    size: Size::new(Val::Px(50.0), Val::Px(50.0)),\n                    ..Default::default()\n                },\n                material: materials.add(Color::rgb(0.5, 0.5, 1.0).into()),\n                ..Default::default()\n            });\n    });\nFlexbox\nI won't cover how flexbox works here, but you can use all of the same \"flex\" properties you would use in a web context. Here is an example of how you would center two Nodes vertically and horizontally within their parent:\n\ncommands\n    .spawn(NodeComponents {\n        style: Style {\n            size: Size::new(Val::Percent(100.0), Val::Percent(100.0)),\n            justify_content: JustifyContent::Center,\n            align_items: AlignItems::Center,\n            ..Default::default()\n        },\n        material: materials.add(Color::rgb(0.04, 0.04, 0.04).into()),\n        ..Default::default()\n    })\n    .with_children(|parent| {\n        parent\n            .spawn(NodeComponents {\n                style: Style {\n                    size: Size::new(Val::Px(80.0), Val::Px(80.0)),\n                    ..Default::default()\n                },\n                material: materials.add(Color::rgb(0.08, 0.08, 1.0).into()),\n                ..Default::default()\n            })\n            .spawn(NodeComponents {\n                style: Style {\n                    size: Size::new(Val::Px(80.0), Val::Px(80.0)),\n                    ..Default::default()\n                },\n                material: materials.add(Color::rgb(1.0, 0.08, 0.08).into()),\n                ..Default::default()\n            });\n    });\nText and Images\nNodes can also have Text and Image components, which affect the inferred sizes of nodes.\n\ncommands\n    .spawn(TextComponents {\n        text: Text {\n            value: \"Hello from Bevy UI!\".to_string(),\n            font: asset_server.load(\"FiraSans-Bold.ttf\").unwrap(),\n            style: TextStyle {\n                font_size: 25.0,\n                color: Color::WHITE,\n            },\n        },\n        ..Default::default()\n    })\n    .spawn(ImageComponents {\n        style: Style {\n            size: Size::new(Val::Px(200.0), Val::Auto),\n            position_type: PositionType::Absolute,\n            position: Rect {\n                top: Val::Px(10.0),\n                right: Val::Px(10.0),\n                ..Default::default()\n            },\n            ..Default::default()\n        },\n        material: materials.add(asset_server.load(\"bevy_logo.png\").unwrap().into()),\n        ..Default::default()\n    });\nInteraction Events\nNodes with the Interaction\n component will track interaction state. You can easily build widgets like buttons this way:\n\nFor example, here is a system that only runs on Buttons where the Interaction state has changed:\nfn system(_button: &amp;Button, interaction: Mutated&lt;Interaction&gt;) {\n    match *interaction {\n        Interaction::Clicked =&gt; println!(\"clicked\"),\n        Interaction::Hovered =&gt; println!(\"hovered\"),\n        Interaction::None =&gt; {},\n    }\n}\n2D Features\nSprites\nYou can use any Texture\n asset as a sprite directly:\n\nlet texture = asset_server.load(\"icon.png\").unwrap();\ncommands.spawn(SpriteComponents {\n    material: materials.add(texture.into()),\n    ..Default::default()\n});\nSprite Sheets\nSprite sheets (also known as texture atlases) can be used for animations, tile sets, or just for optimized sprite rendering.\n\nlet texture_atlas = TextureAtlas::from_grid(texture_handle, texture.size, 7, 1);\nlet texture_atlas_handle = texture_atlases.add(texture_atlas);\ncommands\n    .spawn(SpriteSheetComponents {\n        texture_atlas: texture_atlas_handle,\n        sprite: TextureAtlasSprite::new(0),\n        ..Default::default()\n    });\nDynamic Texture Atlas Generation\nSprites are often produced as individual files. Bevy can combine them into a single sprite sheet dynamically!\n\nfor sprite_handle in sprite_handles.iter() {\n    let texture = textures.get(&amp;handle).unwrap();\n    texture_atlas_builder.add_texture(handle, &amp;texture);\n}\n\nlet texture_atlas = texture_atlas_builder.finish(&amp;mut textures).unwrap();\n3D Features\nGLTF Model Loading\nLoad GLTF files as Mesh assets \n\n.spawn(PbrComponents {\n    // load the model\n    mesh: asset_server.load(\"boat.gltf\").unwrap(),\n    // create a material for the model\n    material: materials.add(asset_server.load(\"boat.png\").into()),\n    ..Default::default()\n})\n\nNote: in the near future we will add support for loading GLTF files as Scenes instead of meshes.\nDepth Based Draw Order\nFront-to-back drawing for fast \"early fragment discarding\" of opaque materials, and back-to-front drawing for correct transparent materials\n\nParenting\nParent transforms are propagated to their descendants\n\n.spawn(PbrComponents {\n    mesh: cube_handle,\n    ..Default::default()\n}).with_children(|parent| {\n    parent.spawn(PbrComponents {\n        mesh: cube_handle,\n        translation: Translation::new(0.0, 2.0, 0.0),\n        ..Default::default()\n    });\n})\nMSAA\nGet nice smooth edges by using Multi-Sample Anti-Aliasing\n\n\napp.add_resource(Msaa { samples: 8 })\nScenes\nScenes are a way to compose pieces of your game/app ahead of time. In Bevy, Scenes are simply a collection of entities and components. A Scene can be \"spawned\" into a World any number of times. \"Spawning\" copies the Scene's entities and components into the given World.\nScenes can also be saved to and loaded from \"scene files\". One of the primary goals of the future \"Bevy Editor\" will be to make it easy to compose scene files visually.\nFile Format\nScene files are a saved and loaded as a flat list of entities and components:\n[\n  (\n    entity: 328997855,\n    components: [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"Position\",\n        \"map\": { \"x\": 3.0, \"y\": 4.0 },\n      },\n    ],\n  ),\n  (\n    entity: 404566393,\n    components: [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"Position\",\n        \"map\": { \"x\": 1.0, \"y\": 2.0 },\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"Name\",\n        \"map\": { \"value\": \"Carter\" },\n      },\n    ],\n  ),\n]\n\nThe numbers assigned to the entity fields are entity's id, which are completely optional. If no entity id is provided, one will be randomly generated when the scene is loaded. We have plans to improve this format in the future to be more ergonomic, indent entity hierarchies, and support nested scenes.\nLoading and Instancing\nScenes can be added to a World using the SceneSpawner\n resource. Spawning can be done with either SceneSpawner::load()\n or SceneSpawner::instance()\n. \"Loading\" a Scene preserves the entity IDs in it. This is useful for something like a save file where you want entity ids to be constant and changes to be applied on top of entities already in the world. \"Instancing\" adds entities to the World with brand-new IDs, which allows multiple \"instances\" of a scene to exist in the same World.\nfn load_scene_system(asset_server: Res&lt;AssetServer&gt;, mut scene_spawner: ResMut&lt;SceneSpawner&gt;) {\n    // Scenes are loaded just like any other asset.\n    let scene: Handle&lt;Scene&gt; = asset_server.load(\"my_scene.scn\").unwrap();\n    // Spawns the scene with entity ids preserved\n    scene_spawner.load(scene);\n    // Spawns the scene with new entity ids\n    scene_spawner.instance(scene);\n}\nSaving ECS Worlds To Scenes\nAny ECS World can be converted to a scene like this:\nlet scene = Scene::from_world(&amp;world, &amp;component_type_registry);\n\nYou can then convert the scene to a RON formatted string like this: \nlet ron_string = scene.serialize_ron(&amp;property_type_registry)?;\nHot Scene Reloading\nChanges to Scene files can be automatically applied to spawned Scenes at runtime. This allows for immediate feedback without restarts or recompiles.\n\nNote that the video above is not sped up. Scene changes are effectively applied instantaneously.\nHow Does This Work?\nScenes are built on top of Bevy's Property and Asset systems. Components can be used in scenes provided they derive the Properties trait. Properties are what enable scene serialization, deserialization, and patching changes at runtime. Check out the next section for more details.\nProperties\nIn a nutshell, Bevy Properties add some dynamism to Rust, which is a notoriously static language. It is often useful to get or set a struct's field using a string version of its name, or interact with a struct when you don't have a statically typed reference. Languages generally cover these cases with \"reflection\" features, but unfortunately Rust does not currently have this type of reflection. I built the bevy_property crate to provide a subset of useful \"reflection-like\" features in Rust. Here is a quick surface-level introduction:\n#[derive(Properties)]\npub struct Counter {\n    count: u32,\n}\n\nlet mut counter = Counter { count: 1 };\n\n// You can set a property value like this. The type must match exactly or this will fail.\ncounter.set_prop_val::&lt;u32&gt;(\"count\", 2);\nassert_eq!(counter.count, 2);\nassert_eq!(counter.prop_val::&lt;u32&gt;(\"count\").unwrap(), 2);\n\n// You can also set properties dynamically. set_prop accepts any type that implements the Property trait, but the property type must match the field type or this operation will fail.\nlet new_count: u32 = 3;\ncounter.set_prop(\"count\", &amp;new_count);\nassert_eq!(counter.count, 3);\n\n// DynamicProperties also implements the Properties trait, but it has no restrictions on field names or types\nlet mut patch = DynamicProperties::map();\npatch.set_prop_val::&lt;usize&gt;(\"count\", 4);\n\n// You can \"apply\" Properties on top of other Properties. This will only set properties with the same name and type. You can use this to \"patch\" your properties with new values.\ncounter.apply(&amp;patch);\nassert_eq!(counter.count, 4);\n\n// Types that implement Properties can be converted to DynamicProperties\nlet dynamic_thing: DynamicProperties = counter.to_dynamic();\n\nProperties are what make Bevy's Scene system so nice to use. I also plan to use them for features in the upcoming Bevy Editor, such as undo/redo, viewing and editing component properties at runtime, and property animation tools.\nTypes that implement Properties can be serialized using serde and DynamicProperties can be deserialized using serde. When combined with the Properties patching feature, this means any type that derives Properties can be round trip serialized and deserialized.\nTo derive Properties each field in the struct must implement the Property trait. This is already implemented for most core Rust and Bevy types, so you should only need to implement Property for custom types (and you can derive Property too).\nI have a feeling that the bevy_property crate will be useful in non-Bevy contexts, so I'll be publishing it to crates.io in the near future.\nEvents\nBevy uses a double-buffered event system that enables efficient event production and consumption with zero-allocation event consumers. Here is a complete Bevy app that produces and consumes a custom event:\nfn main() {\n    App::build()\n        .add_event::&lt;MyEvent&gt;()\n        .add_system(event_producer.system())\n        .add_system(event_consumer.system())\n        .run();\n}\n\nstruct MyEvent {\n    message: String,\n}\n\nfn event_producer(mut my_events: ResMut&lt;Events&lt;MyEvent&gt;&gt;) {\n    my_events.send(MyEvent { message: \"Hello\".to_string() });\n}\n\n#[derive(Default)]\nstruct State {\n    reader: EventReader&lt;MyEvent&gt;, \n}\n\nfn event_consumer(mut state: Local&lt;State&gt;, my_events: Res&lt;Events&lt;MyEvent&gt;&gt;) {\n    for event in state.reader.iter(&amp;my_events) {\n        println!(\"received message: {}\", event.message);\n    }\n}\n\napp.add_event::&lt;MyEvent&gt;() adds a new Events\n resource for MyEvent and a system that swaps the Events&lt;MyEvent&gt; buffers every update.  EventReaders\n are very cheap to create. They are essentially just an array index that tracks the last event that has been read.\nEvents are used in Bevy for features like window resizing, assets, and input. The tradeoff for being both allocation and cpu efficient is that each system only has one chance to receive an event, otherwise it will be lost on the next update. I believe this is the correct tradeoff for apps that run in a loop (ex: games).\nAssets\nBevy Assets\n are just typed data that can be referenced using asset Handles\n . For example, 3d meshes, textures, fonts, materials, scenes, and sounds are assets. Assets&lt;T&gt; is a generic collection of assets of type T. In general asset usage looks like this:\nAsset Creation\nfn create_texture_system(mut textures: ResMut&lt;Assets&lt;Texture&gt;&gt;) {\n    // creates a new Texture asset and returns a handle, which can then be used to retrieve the actual asset\n    let texture_handle: Handle&lt;Texture&gt; = textures.add(Texture::default());\n}\nAsset Access\nfn read_texture_system(textures: Res&lt;Assets&lt;Texture&gt;&gt;, texture_handle: &amp;Handle&lt;Texture&gt;) {\n    // retrieves a Texture using the current entity's Handle&lt;Texture&gt; component\n    let texture: &amp;Texture = textures.get(texture_handle).unwrap();\n}\nAsset Events\nThe Assets&lt;T&gt; collection is basically just a map from Handle&lt;T&gt; to T that records created, modified, and removed Events. These events can also be consumed as a system resource, just like any other Events:\nfn system(mut state: Local&lt;State&gt;, texture_events: Res&lt;Events&lt;AssetEvent&gt;&gt;) {\n    for event in state.reader.iter(&amp;texture_events) {\n        if let AssetEvent::Created { handle } = event {\n            /* do something with created asset */\n        }\n    }\n}\nAsset Server\nThe Assets&lt;T&gt; collection doesn't know anything about filesystems or multi-threading. This is the responsibility of the AssetServer\n resource:\nfn system(mut commands: Commands, asset_server: Res&lt;AssetServer&gt;, mut textures: ResMut&lt;Assets&lt;Texture&gt;&gt;) {\n    // this will begin asynchronously loading \"texture.png\" in parallel \n    let texture_handle: Handle&lt;Texture&gt; = asset_server.load(\"texture.png\").unwrap();\n\n    // the texture may not be loaded yet, but you can still add the handle as a component immediately.\n    // whenever possible, internal Bevy systems will wait for assets to be ready before using them:\n    let entity = commands.spawn((texture_handle,));\n\n    // you can also asynchronously load entire folders (recursively) by adding them as an \"asset folder\"\n    asset_server.load_asset_folder(\"assets\").unwrap();\n\n    // you can get the handle of any asset (either currently loading or loaded) like this:\n    let music_handle: Handle&lt;AudioSource&gt; = asset_server.get_handle(\"assets/music.mp3\").unwrap(); \n\n    // when assets have finished loading, they are automatically added to the appropriate Assets&lt;T&gt; collection\n    // you can check if an asset is ready like this:\n    if let Some(texture) = textures.get(&amp;texture_handle) {\n        // do something with texture\n    }\n\n    // sometimes you want access to an asset immediately. you can block the current system until an asset has\n    // finished loading and immediately update Assets&lt;T&gt; using the \"load_sync\" method\n    let cool_sprite: &amp;Texture =  asset_server.load_sync(&amp;mut textures, \"assets/cool_sprite.png\").unwrap();\n}\nHot Reloading\nYou can enable asset change detection by calling:\nasset_server.watch_for_changes().unwrap();\n\nThis will load new versions of assets whenever their files have changed.\nAdding New Asset Types\nTo add a new asset type, implement the AssetLoader\n trait. This tells Bevy what file formats to look for and how to translate the file bytes into the given asset type.\nOnce you have implemented AssetLoader&lt;MyAsset&gt; for MyAssetLoader you can register your new loader like this:\napp.add_asset_loader::&lt;MyAsset, MyAssetLoader&gt;();\n\nThen you can access the Assets&lt;MyAsset&gt; resource, listen for change events, and call asset_server.load(\"something.my_asset\")\nSound\nYou can currently load and play sounds like this:\nfn system(asset_server: Res&lt;AssetServer&gt;, audio_output: Res&lt;AudioOutput&gt;) {\n    let music: Handle&lt;AudioSource&gt; = asset_server.load(\"music.mp3\").unwrap(); \n\n    // this will play the music asynchronously as soon as it has loaded\n    audio_output.play(music);\n\n    // if you already have an AudioSource reference you can play it immediately like this:\n    audio_output.play_source(audio_source);\n}\n\nWe plan on extending the audio system with more control and features in the future. \nRender Graph\nAll render logic is built on top of Bevy's RenderGraph\n. The Render Graph is a way to encode atomic units of render logic. For example, you might create graph nodes for a 2D pass, UI pass, cameras, texture copies, swap chains, etc. Connecting a node to another node indicates that there is a dependency of some kind between them. By encoding render logic this way, the Bevy renderer is able to analyze dependencies and render the graph in parallel. It also has the benefit of encouraging developers to write modular render logic.\nBevy includes a number of nodes by default: CameraNode, PassNode, RenderResourcesNode, SharedBuffersNode, TextureCopyNode, WindowSwapChainNode, and WindowTextureNode. It also provides subgraphs for 2d rendering, 3d rendering, and UI rendering. But you are welcome to create your own nodes, your own graphs, or extend the included graphs!\nData Driven Shaders\nComponents and Assets can derive the RenderResources\n trait, which enables them to be directly copied to GPU resources and used as shader uniforms.\nBinding uniforms to a custom shader is literally as simple as deriving RenderResources on your component or asset: \n#[derive(RenderResources, Default)]\nstruct MyMaterial {\n    pub color: Color,\n}\n\nAnd then adding a new RenderResourceNode to the Render Graph:\n// create the new node\nrender_graph.add_system_node(\"my_material\", RenderResourcesNode::&lt;MyMaterial&gt;::new(true));\n\n// connect the new node to the \"main pass node\"\nrender_graph.add_node_edge(\"my_material\", base::node::MAIN_PASS).unwrap();\n\nFrom there, MyMaterial components will be automatically copied to GPU buffers. A shader can then reference an entity's MyMaterial like this:\nlayout(set = 1, binding = 1) uniform MyMaterial_color {\n    vec4 color;\n};\n\nI think the simplicity of the fully self-contained custom shader example speaks for itself.\nShader Defs\nComponents and Assets can also add \"shader defs\" to selectively enable shader code on a per-entity basis:\n#[derive(RenderResources, ShaderDefs, Default)]\nstruct MyMaterial {\n    pub color: Color,\n    #[render_resource(ignore)]\n    #[shader_def]\n    pub always_blue: bool,\n}\n\nThen in your fragment shader you could do something like this:\nvoid main() {\n    o_Target = color;\n# ifdef MYMATERIAL_ALWAYS_BLUE\n    o_Target = vec4(0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0);\n# endif\n}\n\nAny entity with a MyMaterial component and always_blue: true will be rendered blue. If always_blue is false, it will be rendered with color.\nWe currently use this feature for toggling \"shadeless\" rendering and optional textures, but I anticipate it being useful in a variety of contexts.\nShader Layout Reflection\nBevy can automatically reflect shader data layouts from SpirV shaders (and from GLSL shaders by compiling them to SpirV). This means that creating custom shaders is as simple as this:\nlet shader_stages = ShaderStages {\n    vertex: shaders.add(Shader::from_glsl(ShaderStage::Vertex, VERTEX_SHADER)),\n    fragment: Some(shaders.add(Shader::from_glsl(ShaderStage::Fragment, FRAGMENT_SHADER))),\n};\nlet pipeline_handle = pipelines.add(PipelineDescriptor::default_config(shader_stages));\nProductive Compile Times\nOne of my primary design goals for Bevy is \"productivity\". Game development is an extremely iterative and experimental process full of small changes. If each change takes a significant amount of time to test, then development becomes a grind. Here is my personal \"acceptability scale\" for iterative changes:\n\n0-1 seconds: ideal\n1-3 seconds: fine\n3-5 seconds: annoying\n5-10 seconds: painful but still usable if you are committed\n10+ seconds: completely unusable\n\nNote that these are \"iterative compile times\" not \"clean compile times\". Clean compiles only need to happen once, whereas iterative compiles happen constantly. I care a lot less about the \"clean compile\" metric when it comes to productivity, although it is still important to keep clean compile times down for other reasons.\nOne of the most popular Rust engines today takes over 30 seconds to compile a single newline inserted into trivial examples. That is categorically unproductive and makes real game-dev practically impossible.\nCurrently, with the \"fast compiles\" configuration, changes to Bevy examples can be compiled in ~0.8-3 seconds, based on your computer specs, configuration, and OS choice (more on this later). There is of course always room for improvement here, but Bevy currently falls into my \"usability sweet spot\".\nThe \"Rust compiles slow\" meme exists largely because many Rust projects aren't thinking enough about the compile time performance implications of certain code patterns. Rust code generally compiles slowly for three reasons:\n\nGeneric Monomorphization: The compile step where generic code gets turned into a non-generic copy. Compile times go up as the volume of monomorphized code goes up. To keep costs low you should either avoid generics entirely or keep generic code \"small\" and shallow.\nLink Time: How long it takes to link code. Here the important thing is to keep code volume and dependency counts low.\nLLVM: Rust throws a large amounts of IR code at LLVM and expects it to optimize it. This takes time. Additionally LLVM is optimized for \"fast code at runtime\" more than \"fast code generation\". \n\nThe LLVM bit is out of our hands (for now). Keeping generic usage low and shallow isn't a particularly hard problem, provided you employ that mindset from the beginning. Link times, on the other hand, are a constant and very real \"enemy\" of iterative compile times. Linking happens on every iterative compile. Adding any code to your project will increase link times. Adding any dependency to your project will increase link times.\nThe cards are stacked against us for a variety of reasons:\n\nThe Game Engine Domain\n\nGame engines inherently touch a large number of domains (and therefore involve a large number of dependencies)\nGame engines are \"big\" ... they require a lot of code\n\n\nRust's Design Choices\n\nDependencies are statically linked by default, which means every new dependency adds link times \nRust's default linker is quite slow\nCargo makes taking dependencies very easy. What appears to be a small, simple crate might actually have a large dependency tree\n\n\n\nOne solution to this problem is to avoid dependencies at all costs and write the smallest amount of code that you can. The Macroquad project is a great example of this. They employ a minimalist approach to code and avoid any dependency that doesn't meet their strict compile time requirements. As a result, I think its fair to say that they are the fastest compiling (while still usable) Rust game engine, both for clean and iterative compiles. However their approach comes at the cost of dependency aversion.\nBevy takes a slightly more pragmatic approach. First, being willing to take dependencies is good for the Rust ecosystem. I don't want to ignore all of the great work that has already been done, especially when it comes to projects like winit and wgpu. But we still strive to keep our dependency tree as small as we can. And any dependency that takes Bevy out of the \"ideal to fine\" iterative compile time range must either be pared down or removed. When combined with the \"Fast Compiles\" configuration, this results in nice compile times.\nThe \"Fast Compiles\" Configuration\nThe \"fast compiles\" configuration is how we achieve usable iterative compile times while still taking dependencies. It consists of three parts:\n\nLLD linker: LLD is much faster at linking than the default Rust linker. This is the biggest win.\nNightly Rust Compiler: Gives access to the latest performance improvements and \"unstable\" optimizations. Note that Bevy can still be compiled on stable Rust if that is a requirement for you.\nGeneric Sharing: Allows crates to share monomorphized generic code instead of duplicating it. In some cases this allows us to \"precompile\" generic code so it doesn't affect iterative compiles.\n\nTo enable fast compiles, install the nightly rust compiler and LLD. Then copy this file to YOUR_WORKSPACE/.cargo/config\nCurrent Limitations and Future Improvements\nWhile Bevy is currently \"productive\" by my criteria, it isn't all sunshine and rainbows yet. First, MacOS doesn't have an up-to-date version of the LLD linker and therefore iterative compiles are much slower on that platform. Additionally, LLD is slightly slower on Windows than it is on Linux. On my machine I get ~1.5-3.0 seconds on Windows vs ~0.8-3.0 seconds on Linux.\nDynamic Linking to the Rescue\nAn easy way to cut down on link times is to just dynamically link instead. On my 2013 MacBook Pro running MacOS (with no LLD), I was able to drop iterative Bevy compile times from ~6 seconds to ~0.6 seconds by dynamically linking app plugins. Bevy actually already has support for dynamic App plugins, but the new Bevy ECS does not currently support dynamic linking because it relies on TypeIds (which are incompatible with dynamic linking). Fortunately, I have already solved the TypeId problem in other projects, so we should be able to add this back soon. \nCranelift Rustc Backend\nCranelift is an alternative compiler backend that is optimized for fast compiles. The rustc cranelift backend is rapidly approaching a usable state. I'm hoping it will give us a nice boost eventually.\nExample Game: Breakout\nIf you are curious about what actual Bevy game code looks like, check out the breakout example. Forgive my slightly janky collision code please :)\n\nWhy Build Bevy?\nThere are plenty of fantastic engines out there ... why build another one? Especially when there are already so many in the Rust ecosystem?\nFirst a bit about me: I decided to build Bevy after years of contributing code to other engines (ex: Godot). I spent over four years building a game in Godot and I also have experience with Unity, Unreal, and a number of other frameworks like SDL and Three.js. I have built multiple custom engines in the past using Rust, Go, HTML5, and Java. I have also used and/or closely followed most of the current players in the Rust gamedev ecosystem. I recently quit my job as Senior Software Engineer at Microsoft and my experience there deeply affected my opinions of software and what it should be.\nThese experiences led me to want the following from a game engine:\n\nFree and Open Source: It needs to be free and open source with no strings attached. Games are a huge part of our culture and humanity is investing millions of hours into the development of games. Why are we (as game developers / engine developers) continuing to build up the ecosystems of closed-source monopolies that take cuts of our sales and deny us visibility into the tech we use daily? As a community I believe we can do so much better. This criteria eliminates Unreal and Unity, despite their huge feature sets.\nProductive: It needs to have fast build/run/test loops, which translates to either scripting languages or fast compile times in native languages. But scripting languages introduce runtime overhead, cognitive load, and a barrier between me and the actual engine, so my preference here is a native language with fast compile times. Sadly compile times are a huge problem in the Rust ecosystem and many Rust engines have prohibitively long iterative compiles. Fortunately Rust game engines like Macroquad and coffee prove that productive iterative compile times are possible.\nTurtles All The Way Down: Ideally the engine is written in the same language that games are. Being able to run an IDE \"go to definition\" command on a symbol in your game and hop directly into the engine source is an extremely powerful concept. You also don't need to worry about heavy language translation layers or lossy abstractions. If an engine's community builds games in the same language as the engine, they are more likely (and able) to contribute back to the engine.\nSimple: It needs to be easy to use for common tasks, but it also can't hide the details from you. Many engines are either \"easy to use but too high level\" or \"very low level but difficult to do common tasks in\". Additionally, many engines in Rust are littered with lifetimes and generics. Both are powerful tools to be sure, but they also introduce cognitive load and reduce ergonomics. Generics can also have a huge impact on compile times if you aren't careful.\nEditor: It needs to have an (optional) graphical editor. Scene creation is a large part of game development and in many cases visual editors beat code. As a bonus, the editor should be built in the engine. Godot uses this approach and it is so smart. Doing so dogfoods the engine's UI system and creates positive feedback loops. Improvements to the editor are also often improvements to the core engine. It also makes sure your engine is flexible enough to build tooling (and not just games). I personally consider building an engine's editor in another stack to be a missed opportunity (ex: the web, QT, native widgets). \nData Driven: It needs to be data-driven/data-oriented/data-first. ECS is a common way of doing this, but it definitely isn't the only way. These paradigms can make your game faster (cache friendly, easier to parallelize), but they also make common tasks like game state serialization and synchronization delightfully straightforward.\n\nNone of the engines on the market quite line up with what I'm looking for. And the changes required to make them meet my requirements are either massive in scope, impossible (closed source), or unwelcome (the things I want aren't what the developers or customers want). On top of that, making new game engines is fun!\nBevy is not trying to out-compete other open-source game engines. As much as possible we should be collaborating and building common foundations. If you are an open source game engine developer and you think a Bevy component would make your engine better, one of your engine's components could make Bevy better, or both, please reach out! Bevy is already benefitting massively from the efforts of the Rust gamedev ecosystem and we would love to pay it forward in whatever way we can.\nWhat's Next?\nI'm proud of how far Bevy has come in a relatively short period of time, but there is still plenty of work left to do. These will be our focus areas over the coming months:\nPhysically Based Rendering (PBR)\nBevy's current 3D renderer is extremely bare bones. As I primarily make 3D games, improving the 3D renderer is a priority for me. We will be adding PBR shaders, shadows, more lighting options, skeletal animation, improved GLTF import, ambient occlusion (implementation TBD), and probably a bunch of other things.\nEditor\nBevy was architected with a visual editor in mind. The Scene and Properties systems were specifically built to make game&lt;-&gt;editor dataflow nicer. The editor will be built as a Bevy App and will utilize the existing Bevy UI, Bevy ECS, Scene, and Properties features. I like the \"build the editor in the engine\" approach because improvements to the editor are often improvements to the engine, and vice-versa. Additionally, it ensures that Bevy is capable of building non-game apps and tooling.\nPlatform Support: Android, iOS, Web\nUnder the hood Bevy uses winit (for multi-platform windows and input) and wgpu (for multi-platform rendering). Each of these projects has varying degrees of support for the platforms above. And in general Bevy was designed to be platform-agnostic, so supporting the platforms above should be possible with a little bit of work.\nRender Batching and Instancing\nRight now Bevy can render plenty fast for most use cases, but when it comes to rendering huge amounts of objects (tens of thousands) it isn't quite there yet. To accomplish that, we need to implement batching / instancing. These concepts can be defined in a number of ways, but the general gist is that we will be grouping as much geometry and data into the smallest number of draw calls possible, while also reducing GPU state changes as much as possible. I'm hoping Bevy's data driven shader approach will make the instancing implementation simple and extensible.\nCanvas\nRight now the only way to draw UI and 2D scenes is via sprites and rectangles. Bevy needs an immediate-mode drawing api capable of drawing anti-aliased curves and shapes. This can then be used to do code-driven drawing of things like rounded corners in Bevy UI, performance graphs in the editor, etc. It's very possible that we will integrate projects like pathfinder or lyon for this.\nAnimation\nAnimation permeates almost everything in gamedev. First, I want to add a general purpose code-first animation system. Then on top of that we will add a property-based timeline system that can be saved to a config file and visualized / edited in the Bevy Editor.\nNicer Scene Format\nThe current scene format is workable, but it isn't yet ideal for manual scene composition because it is a flat list of unordered entities. I also want to add nested scenes. Eventually, I would like the scene format to look something like this.\nDynamic Plugin Loading\nTo mitigate the cost of compiling and linking plugins and make hot-code-reloading possible, we will provide the option to dynamically load App plugins. Bevy actually already supports this feature, but there is one hangup: Rust's TypeId. TypeIds are unstable across binaries, which means TypeId::of::&lt;T&gt;() in the host binary will not match TypeId::of::&lt;T&gt;() in a dynamically loaded binary. Bevy ECS uses TypeIds, which means dynamically loaded ECS types won't behave correctly. In the past, Bevy used a custom fork of the Legion ECS (where we fixed the TypeId problem). But since moving to Bevy ECS the problem has resurfaced. The fix is to apply the same approach we used in Legion to Bevy ECS. \nPhysics\nMany games require collision detection and physics. I'm planning on building a plug-able physics interface with nphysics / ncollide as the first backend.\nPolish\nThere are plenty of areas that need more design work or features. For example, I think the core Render Graph is in a pretty good state, but the mid-level and high level rendering APIs need more time and experimentation. I also want to rethink how materials are composed. If you are curious about all of the improvements on our radar, check out the Bevy issue tracker on GitHub.\nDocumentation\nBevy's APIs are still very unstable, so I haven't spent much time documenting anything yet. The Bevy Book is still small and the Rust API Docs have plenty of gaps. In general I subscribe to the idea of \"documentation proportional to stability\". As features stabilize and design patterns emerge, we will increase efforts in both of those areas.\nJoin the Bevy!\nIf any of this sounds interesting to you, I encourage you to check out Bevy on GitHub, read The Bevy Book, and join the Bevy community.

Bevy was only released a week ago and we've already hit some pretty major milestones:\n\n    \n         3rd most popular /r/rust post of all time\n        \n    \n    \n        #2 on Hacker News\n        \n    \n    \n        2,200 Github Stars\n        \n    \n    \n        26 contributors\n        \n    \n    \n        644 Discord Users\n        \n    \n    \n        37% of the way to making my full time Bevy development sustainable\n        \n    \n    \n        A truly awesome number of community-developed plugins, games, and apps\n        \n    \n\nHow can Bevy operate at this scale?\nI didn't in my wildest dreams anticipate a community to show up so quickly and in such force. Clearly the Bevy project resonates with people! This is wonderful, but it also presents some interesting challenges that I thought I would have a lot more time to solve:\n\nI am a bottleneck: Right now I am the only one with the right to merge code. This can't change until people get ramped up and trust is built.\nEveryone is fresh: Everyone is new to the codebase, so changes require a lot of scrutiny, and developers need a lot of guidance.\nNo structure: We don't have an organization or a well-defined development process.\n\nBefore we try to solve these problems, I think we need to ask ourselves:\nWhat made Bevy \"good\"?\nI think this is actually a relatively straightforward answer. I think it boils down to:\n\nLearn from the best: I thoroughly reviewed at all of the existing options, learned all I could from them, and either built something new based on those learnings or made iterative improvements\nFreedom to experiment: I was unencumbered by stability guarantees, pressure to make the \"right\" call every time, or deadlines\nFocus: I was able to work on Bevy full time with zero distractions for ~5 months\n\nHow can we replicate this process at the new scale of the Bevy community? And how can I personally replicate this now that my job title has changed from \"solo incognito moonshot project architect\" to \"lead architect\" / \"project manager\" / \"community manager\" of a project with a developer community numbering in the thousands?\nThe Plan\nI don't think now is the time to get bogged down in complex organizational structures or RFC processes. Eventually we will need those tools, but I don't think we're there yet. Instead I'm going to try to re-create the conditions I've been operating under for the last five months:\nBDFALAICMI\nI plan on being a Benevolent Dictator For As Long As I Can Manage It. I will personally review every PR that gets merged and every design decision made. Eventually (if we do this right) that will become impossible, but we aren’t there yet. As I build trust in contributors and the project expands I will eventually start delegating. But I will always bias toward “small and focused”. My general skill-set and preference is to be a full time software developer / architect, but I have accepted that I need to balance that with being a project and community manager. My short term goal will be to drive down our massive Issue and PR backlog :)\nFocus Focus Focus\nWe have a long road ahead of us. Building an engine is a lot like leveling up a skill tree in a game. Some features can't (or shouldn't) be built until we have built their predecessors. An example of this is the Bevy Editor. Before we break ground on the editor, we need to make sure Bevy UI and Bevy Scenes are in a good spot. I am just one person. I have limited bandwidth to build designs and review proposals, so I can't afford to waste energy on the editor yet.\nAt a given point in time, Bevy will have 3 focus areas. These areas will receive priority for my time, and I will try my best to direct contributors to those areas. This doesn't mean others aren't free to explore other areas they are interested in. Just don't expect to get them merged quickly. Ideally you're building a standalone plugin that doesn't require being directly merged into the Bevy repo anyway. \nFast and Loose\nI don't want to get stuck in \"design hell\". We can debate the best way to build a PBR renderer for years. But without implementations and hard data, it is very hard to determine what is actually best in practice. I want to see code. Production-readiness is a non-feature. A good idea is nice, but if there is no implementation it isn't real to me. We need capable people to take good ideas and make them real. The faster we can try different approaches, the better. For now the general process will be:\n\nIdentify a focus area and communicate the general direction Bevy should be taking in this area\nEncourage contributors to create their own \"prototype\" crates. In some cases I will create my own. The Bevy project will provide a centralized list of these crates, which will facilitate discover-ability and help consolidate efforts. If you make a crate, please use the bevy_prototype_XXX format for crate names to respect the bevy_XXX namespace. This approach will allow us to \"scale out\" without too much process or centralization.\nOnce we have working prototypes we can start to try building consensus. We can afford to take our time here. The prototype features will already be out there for the people that want them. The cost of merging something too early is high. Merging something is a signal that we have picked a path and are committed to it. At that point experimentation becomes costly and painful for Bevy crate consumers. For now I will have the final say on what gets merged and when it happens. It will be the job of the community to convince me to take a given path, but I promise I'm reasonable! And I will defer to subject matter experts when it makes sense.\n\nCollaborate\nBevy has caught the attention of many popular Rust projects. We are currently discussing the best way to collaborate with Amethyst Engine. I'm also talking to a number of other Rust project leads about the best way to make Bevy a good ecosystem player. As much as possible we should be building up common foundations. Please reach out to me (Twitter DMs or on Discord) if you know of potential collaboration areas. \nBevy's Current Focus Areas\nHere are Bevy's current focus areas. I will direct my attention and attempt to direct everyone elses' attention to them. There are no deadlines. We will take as long as we need to get them right. I will work as hard as I can (full-time) to ensure we make quick progress on them: \nEditor-Ready UI\nBefore we can start work on the Bevy Editor, we need a solid UI implementation. Bevy UI already has nice \"flexbox\" layout, and we already have a first stab at buttons and interaction events. But Bevy UI still needs a lot more experimentation if we're going to find the \"right\" patterns and paradigms. Editor-Ready UI has the following requirements:\n\nEmbraces the Bevy architecture: Bevy ECS, Bevy Scenes, Bevy Assets, Bevy Events \nA Canvas-style API for drawing widgets with shapes and anti-aliased curves\nDefine a consistent way to implement widgets\nA core set of widgets: buttons, inputs, resizable panels, etc\nTheme-ability\n\"Interaction\" and \"focus\" events\nTranslation-friendly. We can't be anglo-centric here\n\nSuggesting other UI frameworks or stacks is out of scope. The Bevy Editor will be built on top of Bevy UI. See the Introducing Bevy blog post for my rationale. \nPhysically Based Rendering (PBR)\nPBR is a standard-ish way of rendering realistically in 3D. There is both a lot of interest and a lot of brain-power in this area, so it makes sense to build PBR now. This focus area has the following (minimum) requirements:\n\nPBR Shaders (which implies hdr)\nBloom (to convey hdr)\nShadowing (forces us to build out a real \"pipeline\")\nBattle-test the current mid-level rendering abstractions and rework them where necessary\n\nScenes\nBevy Scenes currently do most of what we want, but they need a bit more work before they can be the foundation of Bevy state management. This focus area is also a requirement for the Bevy Editor.\n\nAsset Management: Inline assets, asset dependencies, stable ids when loaded from the disk\nBetter Scene Format: Improve the legibility and ergonomics of scene files to make them easy to read and easy to compose by hand. We're shooting for something close to this.\nEnabling/Disabling Systems: Scenes should be able to toggle their required systems on and off when they are added / removed\n\nWant to help?\nIf you want to hop on this wild ride with us, here are a few ways you can help:\n\nContribute To Prototype Plugins: Start building new prototype Bevy plugins and contribute to the one's others are working on. Ideally in the focus areas above. At this point we are looking for fast prototypes that demonstrate new ideas. If you want to get started on a project within a given focus area:\n\nRead through the corresponding focus-area issue on GitHub\nLook for current projects in that issue and find potential collaboration areas.\nIf you can't find an existing project and you want to start one, set up a new crate/repo and link to it in the \"focus-area\" issue. We will maintain an index of active projects at the top of the thread. We will also encourage collaboration when it looks like there are overly-redundant efforts.\n\n\nAssist the Bevy Community: If you are able, help us resolve issues on the Bevy Issue Tracker, review pull requests, and provide help on the #help channel of our Discord. It is a real challenge to keep up with the sheer volume of work here, so any help is very very appreciated.\nHelp Me Make Full Time Development Sustainable: I need your help to make Bevy development sustainable! Five months ago I quit my comfortable Senior Software Engineer job at Microsoft to work on Bevy full time. I am currently paying my rent and living expenses out of pocket. I can't sustain this for long, as much as I want to. We're already 37% of the way to sustainable development and it has only been two days!\n\nI'm looking forward to seeing you in the Bevy Community!\n","id":"https://bevyengine.org/news/scaling-bevy/","title":"Scaling Bevy"}},"docInfo":{"https://bevyengine.org/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://bevyengine.org/community/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://bevyengine.org/learn/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/contributing/":{"body":48,"title":1},"https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/contributing/code/":{"body":74,"title":1},"https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/contributing/docs/":{"body":166,"title":1},"https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/faq/":{"body":447,"title":1},"https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/":{"body":156,"title":2},"https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/apps/":{"body":47,"title":1},"https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/ecs/":{"body":400,"title":1},"https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/plugins/":{"body":279,"title":1},"https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/resources/":{"body":199,"title":1},"https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/setup/":{"body":501,"title":1},"https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/introduction/":{"body":198,"title":1},"https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/next-steps/":{"body":50,"title":2},"https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/troubleshooting/":{"body":51,"title":1},"https://bevyengine.org/news/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-2/":{"body":1109,"title":2},"https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-3/":{"body":2263,"title":2},"https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-4/":{"body":3005,"title":2},"https://bevyengine.org/news/introducing-bevy/":{"body":4749,"title":3},"https://bevyengine.org/news/scaling-bevy/":{"body":979,"title":2}},"length":22},"lang":"English"};
